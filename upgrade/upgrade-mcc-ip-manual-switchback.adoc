Perform the switchback operation to return the MetroCluster configuration to normal operation. The nodes on site_A are still awaiting upgrade.

.Steps

. Issue the `metrocluster node show` command on site_B and check the output.
 .. Verify that the new nodes are represented correctly.
 .. Verify that the new nodes are in "Waiting for switchback state."
. Perform the healing and switchback by running the required commands from any node in the active cluster (the cluster that is not undergoing upgrade).
 .. Heal the data aggregates:
 +
`metrocluster heal aggregates`
 .. Heal the root aggregates:
+
`metrocluster heal root`
 .. Switchback the cluster:
+
`metrocluster switchback`
. Check the progress of the switchback operation:
+
`metrocluster show`
+
The switchback operation is still in progress when the output displays `waiting-for-switchback`:

If a switchback takes a long time to finish, you can check on the status of in-progress baselines by using the `metrocluster config-replication resync-status show` command. This command is at the advanced privilege level.
