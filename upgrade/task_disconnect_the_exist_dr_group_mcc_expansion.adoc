[.lead]
You must disconnect the existing controller modules from the FC switches in the fabric.

This task must be performed at each MetroCluster site.

. Disable the HBA ports that connect the existing controller modules to the switch fabric undergoing maintenance: `storage port disable -node node-name -port port-number`
. On the local FC switches, remove the cables from the ports for the existing controller module's HBA, FC-VI, and ATTO bridges.
+
You should label the cables for easy identification when you recable them. Only the ISL ports should remain cabled.
