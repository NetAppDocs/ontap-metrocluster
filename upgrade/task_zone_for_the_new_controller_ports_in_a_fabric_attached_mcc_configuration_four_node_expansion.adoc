The FC switch zoning must accommodate the new controller connections. If you used the NetApp-supplied reference configuration files (RCFs) to configure your switches, the zoning is preconfigured and you do not need to make any changes.

If you manually configured your FC switches, you must ensure that the zoning is correct for the initiator connections from the new controller modules. See the sections on zoning in the _Fabric-attached MetroCluster Installation and Configuration Guide_.
