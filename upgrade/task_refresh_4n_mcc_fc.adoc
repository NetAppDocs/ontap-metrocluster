[.lead]
You can upgrade the controllers and storage in a four-node MetroCluster configuration by expanding the configuration to become an eight-node configuration and then removing the old disaster recovery (DR) group.

.About this task

References to "old nodes" mean the nodes that you intend to replace.

* You can only refresh specific platform models using this procedure in a MetroCluster FC configuration. 
** For information on what platform upgrade combinations are supported review the MetroCluster FC refresh table in  link:../upgrade/concept_choosing_tech_refresh_mcc.html#supported-metrocluster-fc-tech-refresh-combinations[Choosing a system refresh method].

== Perform the refresh procedure

Use the following steps to refresh the MetroCluster FC configuration. 

.Steps

. Gather information from the old nodes.

At this stage, the four-node configuration appears as shown in the following image:

. Perform all of the steps in the four-node expansion procedure for your MetroCluster type.

+
When the expansion procedure is complete, the configuration appears as shown in the following image:

. Move the CRS volumes.

Perform the steps in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/task_move_a_metadata_volume_in_mcc_configurations.html[Move a metadata volume in MetroCluster configurations^].

. Move the data from the old nodes to new nodes using the following procedures:

.. Perform all the steps in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade/upgrade-create-aggregate-move-volumes.html[Create an aggregate and moving volumes to the new nodes^].
+
NOTE: You might choose to mirror the aggregate when or after it is created.

.. Perform all the steps in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade/upgrade-move-lifs-to-new-nodes.html[Move non-SAN data LIFs and cluster management LIFs to the new nodes^].
.. Perform all the steps in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade/upgrade-delete-san-lifs.html[Delete SAN LIFs no longer required from the original nodes^].

. Follow the steps in the procedure for removing the old DR group.
