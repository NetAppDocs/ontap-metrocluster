You can upgrade the controllers and storage in a four-node MetroCluster configuration by expanding the configuration to become an eight-node configuration and then removing the old disaster recovery (DR) group.

References to "old nodes" mean the nodes that you intend to replace.

.Steps
. Gather information from the old nodes.
+
At this stage, the four-node configuration appears as shown in the following image:

. Perform all of the steps in the four-node expansion procedure for your MetroCluster type.

+
When the expansion procedure is complete, the configuration appears as shown in the following image:

. Move the CRS volumes.

. Move the data from the old nodes to new nodes using the following three procedures from the _Controller Hardware Upgrade Express Guide_.

NOTE: You might choose to mirror the aggregate when or after it is created.
