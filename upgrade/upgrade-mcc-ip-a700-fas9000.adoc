You can use the MetroCluster switchover operation to provide nondisruptive service to clients while the controller modules on the partner cluster are upgraded. Other components (such as storage shelves or switches) cannot be upgraded as part of this procedure. 

NOTE: This procedure only supports upgrades from an AFF A700 to an AFF A900 system or from a FAS9000 to a FAS9500 system.
