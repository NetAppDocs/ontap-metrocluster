= Refresh a four-node or an eight-node MetroCluster IP configuration (ONTAP 9.8 and later)
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You can use this procedure to upgrade controllers and storage in four-node or eight-node configurations.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can upgrade the controllers and storage in an eight-node MetroCluster IP configuration by expanding the configuration to become a temporary twelve-node configuration and then removing the old disaster recovery (DR) groups.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can upgrade the controllers and storage in a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration by expanding the configuration to become a temporary eight-node configuration and then removing the old DR group.

.About this task

* If you have an eight-node configuration, your system must be running ONTAP 9.13.1 or later.
* If you have a four-node configuration, your system must be running ONTAP 9.8 or later.
* If you are also upgrading the IP switches, you must upgrade them before performing this refresh procedure.
* This procedure describes the steps required to refresh one four-node DR group. If you have an eight-node configuration (two DR groups) you can refresh one or both DR groups. 
+
If you refresh both DR groups, you must refresh one DR group at a time. 
* References to "old nodes" mean the nodes that you intend to replace.
* For eight-node configurations, the source and target eight-node MetroCluster platform combination must be supported. 
+
NOTE: If you refresh both DR groups, the platform combination might not be supported after you refresh the first DR group. You must refresh both DR groups to achieve a supported eight-node configuration.

* You can only refresh specific platform models using this procedure in a MetroCluster IP configuration. 
** For information on which platform upgrade combinations are supported, review the MetroCluster IP refresh table in  link:../upgrade/concept_choosing_tech_refresh_mcc.html#supported-metrocluster-ip-tech-refresh-combinations[Choosing a system refresh method].
* The lower limits of the source and target platforms apply. If you transition to a higher platform, the limits of the new platform applies only after the tech refresh of all DR groups completes.
* If you perform a tech refresh to a platform with lower limits than the source platform, you must adjust and reduce the limits to be at, or below, the target platform limits before performing this procedure.

== Perform the refresh procedure

.Steps

. Verify that you have a default broadcast domain created on the old nodes. 
+
When you add new nodes to an existing cluster without a default broadcast domain, node management LIFs are created for the new nodes using universal unique identifiers (UUIDs) instead of the expected names. For more information, see the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/Node_management_LIFs_on_newly-added_nodes_generated_with_UUID_names[Node management LIFs on newly-added nodes generated with UUID names^].
. Gather information from the old nodes.
+
At this stage, the four-node configuration appears as shown in the following image:
+
image::../media/mcc_dr_group_a.png[]
+
The eight-node configuration appears as shown in the following image:
+
image::../media/mcc_dr_groups_8_node.gif[]

. To prevent automatic support case generation, send an AutoSupport message to indicate the upgrade is underway.
.. Issue the following command:
 +
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message "MAINT=10h Upgrading _old-model_ to _new-model"_`
+
The following example specifies a 10 hour maintenance window. You might want to allow additional time depending on your plan.
+
If the maintenance is completed before the time has elapsed, you can invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the end of the maintenance period:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`

.. Repeat the command on the partner cluster.

. If end-to-end encryption is enabled, follow the steps to link:../maintain/task-configure-encryption.html#disable-end-to-end-encryption[Disable end-to-end encryption].

. Remove the existing MetroCluster configuration from Tiebreaker, Mediator, or other software that can initiate switchover.

a|
Tiebreaker
a|
. Use the Tiebreaker CLI `monitor remove` command to remove the MetroCluster configuration.
+
In the following example, "`cluster_A`" is removed from the software:
+
----

NetApp MetroCluster Tiebreaker :> monitor remove -monitor-name cluster_A
Successfully removed monitor from NetApp MetroCluster Tiebreaker
software.
----

. Confirm that the MetroCluster configuration is removed correctly by using the Tiebreaker CLI `monitor show -status` command.
+
----

NetApp MetroCluster Tiebreaker :> monitor show -status

image::../media/mcc_dr_group_c4.png[]

. Confirm that takeover is possible and the nodes are connected by running the following command on both clusters: 
+
`storage failover show`
+
----
cluster_A::> storage failover show
                                    Takeover

. Move the CRS volumes.
+
Perform the steps in link:../maintain/task_move_a_metadata_volume_in_mcc_configurations.html[Moving a metadata volume in MetroCluster configurations^].
//ONTAPDOC-1711

. Move the data from the old nodes to the new nodes by using the following procedures:

.. Perform all the steps in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade/upgrade-create-aggregate-move-volumes.html[Create an aggregate and move volumes to the new nodes^].
+
NOTE: You might choose to mirror the aggregate when or after it is created.
 .. Perform all the steps in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade/upgrade-move-lifs-to-new-nodes.html[Move non-SAN data LIFs and cluster-management LIFs to the new nodes^].

. Modify the IP address for the cluster peer of the transitioned nodes for each cluster:
.. Identify the cluster_A peer by using the `cluster peer show` command:
+
----
cluster_A::> cluster peer show
Peer Cluster Name         Cluster Serial Number Availability   Authentication
------------------------- --------------------- -------------- --------------
cluster_B         1-80-000011           Unavailable    absent
----

... Modify the cluster_A peer IP address:
+
`cluster peer modify -cluster cluster_A -peer-addrs node_A_3_IP -address-family ipv4`


.. Identify the cluster_B peer by using the `cluster peer show` command:
+
----
cluster_B::> cluster peer show
Peer Cluster Name         Cluster Serial Number Availability   Authentication
------------------------- --------------------- -------------- --------------
cluster_A         1-80-000011           Unavailable    absent
----
... Modify the cluster_B peer IP address:
+
`cluster peer modify -cluster cluster_B -peer-addrs node_B_3_IP -address-family ipv4`

.. Verify that the cluster peer IP address is updated for each cluster:
... Verify that the IP address is updated for each cluster by using the `cluster peer show -instance` command.
+
The `Remote Intercluster Addresses` field in the following examples displays the updated IP address.

. Follow the steps in link:concept_removing_a_disaster_recovery_group.html[Removing a Disaster Recovery group] to remove the old DR group.
+
. If you want to refresh both DR groups in an eight-node configuration, you must repeat the entire procedure for each DR group.
+
After you have removed the old DR group, the configuration appears as shown in the following images:
+
.Four-node configuration
image::../media/mcc_dr_group_d.png[]
+
.Eight-node configuration
+
image::../media/mcc_dr_group_c5.png[]


. Confirm the operational mode of the MetroCluster configuration and perform a MetroCluster check.
.. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is normal:
+
`metrocluster show`

.. Confirm that all expected nodes are shown:
+
`metrocluster node show`

.. Issue the following command:
+
`metrocluster check run`

.. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`metrocluster check show`

. If you disabled end-to-end encryption before adding the new nodes, you can re-enable it by following the steps in link:../maintain/task-configure-encryption.html#enable-end-to-end-encryption[Enable end-to-end encryption].

. Restore monitoring if necessary, using the procedure for your configuration.
