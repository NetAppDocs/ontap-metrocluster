= Refreshing a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration (ONTAP 9.8 and later)

[.lead]
Starting with ONTAP 9.8, you can upgrade the controllers and storage in a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration by expanding the configuration to become a temporary eight-node configuration and then removing the old disaster recovery (DR) group.

* This procedure is supported on systems running ONTAP 9.8 and later.
* If you are upgrading the IP switches, they should be upgraded before to performing this refresh procedure.
* References to "old nodes" mean the nodes that you intend to replace.
* This procedure is not supported on AFF A320 systems configured with Broadcom BES-53248 switches.

.Steps
. Gather information from the old nodes.
+
At this stage, the four-node configuration appears as shown in the following image:
+
image::../media/mcc_dr_group_a.png[]

. To prevent automatic support case generation, send an Autosupport message to indicate the upgrade is underway.
 .. Issue the following command:
 +
`*system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message "MAINT=10h Upgrading _old-model_ to _new-model"_*`
+
Our example specifies a 10 hour maintenance window. You may want to allow additional time depending on your plan.
+
If the maintenance is completed before the time has elapsed, you can invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the end of the maintenance period:
+
`*system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end*`

 .. Repeat the command on the partner cluster.
. Remove the existing MetroCluster configuration from Tiebreaker, Mediator, or other software that can initiate switchover.

. Perform all of the steps in the procedure to add nodes to your MetroCluster IP configuration.

+
When the expansion procedure is complete, the configuration appears as shown in the following image:
+
image::../media/mcc_dr_group_b.png[]

. Move the CRS volumes.
+
Perform the steps in link:../maintain/task_move_a_metadata_volume_in_mcc_configurations.html[Moving a metadata volume in MetroCluster configurations].

. Move the data from the old nodes to new nodes using the following procedures from the _Controller Hardware Upgrade Express Guide_.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/platstor/topic/com.netapp.doc.hw-upgrade-controller/home.html[Other platform procedures:Controller Hardware Upgrade Express Guide]

 .. Perform all the steps in http://docs.netapp.com/platstor/topic/com.netapp.doc.hw-upgrade-controller/GUID-AFE432F6-60AD-4A79-86C0-C7D12957FA63.html[Creating an aggregate and moving volumes to the new nodes].
+
NOTE: You might choose to mirror the aggregate when or after it is created.

 .. Perform all the steps in http://docs.netapp.com/platstor/topic/com.netapp.doc.hw-upgrade-controller/GUID-95CA9262-327D-431D-81AA-C73DEFF3DEE2.html[Moving non-SAN data LIFs and cluster management LIFs to the new nodes].

. Follow the steps in the procedure for removing the old DR group.
+
xref:concept_removing_a_disaster_recovery_group.adoc[Removing a Disaster Recovery group]
+
After you have removed the old DR group (DR group one), the configuration appears as shown in the following image:
+
image::../media/mcc_dr_group_d.png[]

. Confirm the operational mode of the MetroCluster configuration and perform a MetroCluster check.
 .. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is normal:
+
`*metrocluster show*`
 .. Confirm that all expected nodes are shown:
+
`*metrocluster node show*`
 .. Issue the following command:
+
`*metrocluster check run*`
 .. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`*metrocluster check show*`
. Restore monitoring if necessary, using the procedure for your configuration.

`*system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end*`
 .. Repeat the command on the partner cluster.
