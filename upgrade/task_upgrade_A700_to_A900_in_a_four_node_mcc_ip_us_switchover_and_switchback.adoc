= Upgrade controllers from AFF A700 to AFF A900 in a MetroCluster IP configuration using switchover and switchback (ONTAP 9.10.1 and later)

:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Starting with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use the MetroCluster switchover operation to provide nondisruptive service to clients while the controller modules on the partner cluster are upgraded. Other components (such as storage shelves or switches) cannot be upgraded as part of this procedure.

.About this task

* The platforms must be running ONTAP 9.10.1 or later.
* This procedure applies to AFF A700 controller modules upgrading to an AFF A900 in a MetroCluster IP configuration.

+

|===

h| Old platform model h| New platform model
a|
AFF A700
a|
AFF A900
|===

* All controllers in the configuration should be upgraded during the same maintenance period.
+
Operating the MetroCluster configuration with different controller types is not supported outside of this maintenance activity.


* The IP switches must be running a supported firmware version.


* You will reuse the IP addresses, netmasks, and gateways of the original platforms on the new platforms.
* The following example names are used in this procedure:
 ** site_A
  *** Before upgrade:
   **** node_A_1-A700
   **** node_A_2-A700
  *** After upgrade:
   **** node_A_1-A900
   **** node_A_2-A900
 ** site_B
  *** Before upgrade:
   **** node_B_1-A700
   **** node_B_2-A700
  *** After upgrade:
   **** node_B_1-A900
   **** node_B_2-A900

== Workflow for upgrading controllers in an MetroCluster IP configuration

You can use the workflow diagram to help you plan the upgrade tasks.

image::../media/workflow_ip_upgrade.png[]

== Prepare for the upgrade

Before making any changes to the existing MetroCluster configuration, you must check the health of the configuration, prepare the new platforms, and perform other miscellaneous tasks.

=== Update the MetroCluster switch RCF files before upgrading controllers

The MetroCluster configuration on an AFF A900 uses one of each of the ports on the DR cards located in slots 5 and 7. Before starting the upgrade, if there are cards in slot 7 on the AFF A700, you must move them to other slots for all the nodes of the cluster.

The MetroCluster IP configuration on an AFF A700 does not use VLANs. The MetroCluster configuration on an AFF A900 does use VLANs. As a result, you need to change the RCF file when upgrading from an AFF A700 to an AFF A900.



|===

h| Platform model (old or new) h| Supported VLAN IDs

a|

 ** AFF A400

a|

 ** 10
 ** 20
 ** Any value in the range 101 to 4096 inclusive.

|===

* The switch configuration was not configured with minimum supported RCF version:


|===

h| Switch model h| Required RCF file version

a|
Cisco 3132Q-V
a|
REQUIRED from Thomas: RCF version for A900
a|
Cisco 3232C
a|
REQUIRED from Thomas: RCF version for A900
a|
Broadcom BES-53248
a|
REQUIRED from Thomas: RCF version for A900
|===

* You want to change the VLAN configuration.
+
The VLAN ID range is 101 to 4096 inclusive.

The switches at site_A will be upgraded when the controllers on site_A are upgraded.

.Steps

. Prepare the IP switches for the application of the new RCF files.
+
Follow the steps in the section for your switch vendor from the link:../install-ip/index.html[MetroCluster IP Installation and Configuration Guide].

=== Map ports from the old nodes to the new nodes

When upgrading from an AFF A700 to an AFF A900, you do not change the data network ports, FCP SAN adapter ports, and SAS and NVMe storage ports. Data LIFs stay where they are during and after the upgrade. Therefore, you are not required to map the network ports from the old nodes to the to new nodes.

=== Verify MetroCluster health before site upgrade

You must verify the health and connectivity of the MetroCluster configuration prior to performing the upgrade.

.Steps

. Verify the operation of the MetroCluster configuration in ONTAP:
.. Check whether the nodes are multipathed:
 +
`node run -node _node-name_ sysconfig -a`
+
You should issue this command for each node in the MetroCluster configuration.

 .. Verify that there are no broken disks in the configuration:
 +
`storage disk show -broken`
+
You should issue this command on each node in the MetroCluster configuration.

.. Check for any health alerts:
+
`system health alert show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster.

.. Verify the licenses on the clusters:
+
`system license show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster.

.. Verify the devices connected to the nodes:
+
`network device-discovery show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster.

.. Verify that the time zone and time is set correctly on both sites:
+
`cluster date show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster. You can use the `cluster date` commands to configure the time and time zone.
. Confirm the operational mode of the MetroCluster configuration and perform a MetroCluster check.
 .. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is `normal`:
 +
`metrocluster show`
 .. Confirm that all expected nodes are shown:
 +
`metrocluster node show`
 .. Issue the following command:
+
`metrocluster check run`
 .. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`metrocluster check show`
. Check the MetroCluster cabling with the Config Advisor tool.
 .. Download and run Config Advisor.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[NetApp Downloads: Config Advisor]

 .. After running Config Advisor, review the tool's output and follow the recommendations in the output to address any issues discovered.


=== Gather information before the upgrade

Before upgrading, you must gather information for each of the nodes, and, if necessary, adjust the network broadcast domains, remove any VLANs and interface groups, and gather encryption information.

.Steps

 . Record the physical cabling for each node, labelling cables as needed to allow correct cabling of the new nodes.
 . Gather interconnect, port and LIF information for each node.
 +
 You should gather the output of the following commands for each node:

  ** `metrocluster interconnect show`
  ** `metrocluster configuration-settings connection show`
  ** `network interface show -role cluster,node-mgmt`
  ** `network port show -node node_name -type physical`
  ** `network port vlan show -node _node-name_`
  ** `network port ifgrp show -node _node_name_ -instance`
  ** `network port broadcast-domain show`
  ** `network port reachability show -detail`
  ** `network ipspace show`
  ** `volume show`
  ** `storage aggregate show`
  ** `system node run -node _node-name_ sysconfig -a`
  ** `vserver fcp initiator show`
  ** `storage disk show`
  ** `metrocluster configuration-settings interface show`

. Gather the UUIDs for the site_B (the site whose platforms are currently being upgraded): `metrocluster node show -fields node-cluster-uuid, node-uuid`
+
These values must be configured accurately on the new site_B controller modules to ensure a successful upgrade. Copy the values to a file so that you can copy them into the proper commands later in the upgrade process.
 +
The following example shows the command output with the UUIDs:
+
----
cluster_B::> metrocluster node show -fields node-cluster-uuid, node-uuid

. If the MetroCluster nodes are in a SAN configuration, collect the relevant information.
+
You should gather the output of the following commands:

  ** `fcp adapter show -instance`
  ** `fcp interface show -instance`
  ** `iscsi interface show`
  ** `ucadmin show`

 . If the root volume is encrypted, collect and save the passphrase used for key-manager:
 `security key-manager backup show`

 . If the MetroCluster nodes are using encryption for volumes or aggregates, copy information about the keys and passphrases.

 For additional information, see https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.pow-nve/GUID-1677AE0A-FEF7-45FA-8616-885AA3283BCF.html[Backing up onboard key management information manually].

  .. If Onboard Key Manager is configured:
  `security key-manager onboard show-backup`

 You will need the passphrase later in the upgrade procedure.

  .. If enterprise key management (KMIP) is configured, issue the following commands:

 security key-manager external show -instance
 security key-manager key query

 . Gather the system IDs of the existing nodes: `metrocluster node show -fields node-systemid,ha-partner-systemid,dr-partner-systemid,dr-auxiliary-systemid`

=== Remove Mediator or Tiebreaker monitoring

Before the upgrading the platforms, you must remove monitoring if the MetroCluster configuration is monitored with the Tiebreaker or Mediator utility.

.Steps

. Collect the output for the following command:
+
`storage iscsi-initiator show`

. Remove the existing MetroCluster configuration from Tiebreaker, Mediator, or other software that can initiate switchover.

=== Send a custom AutoSupport message prior to maintenance

Before performing the maintenance, you should issue an AutoSupport message to notify NetApp technical support that maintenance is underway. Informing technical support that maintenance is underway prevents them from opening a case on the assumption that a disruption has occurred.

.About this task

This task must be performed on each MetroCluster site.

.Steps

. Log in to the cluster.

. Invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the start of the maintenance:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=__maintenance-window-in-hours__`
+
The `maintenance-window-in-hours` parameter specifies the length of the maintenance window, with a maximum of 72 hours. If the maintenance is completed before the time has elapsed, you can invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the end of the maintenance period:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`

. Repeat these steps on the partner site.

== Switch over the MetroCluster configuration

You must switch over the configuration to site_A so that the platforms on site_B can be upgraded.

.About this task

This task must be performed on site_A.

After completing this task, cluster_A is active and serving data for both sites. cluster_B is inactive, and ready to begin the upgrade process.

image::../media/mcc_upgrade_cluster_a_in_switchover.png[]

.Steps

. Switch over the MetroCluster configuration to site_A so that site_B's nodes can be upgraded:

.. Issue the following command on cluster_A:
+
`metrocluster switchover -controller-replacement true`
+
The operation can take several minutes to complete.

.. Monitor the switchover operation:
+
`metrocluster operation show`

.. After the operation is complete, confirm that the nodes are in switchover state:
+
`metrocluster show`

.. Check the status of the MetroCluster nodes:
+
`metrocluster node show`
+
Automatic healing of aggregates after negotiated switchover is disabled during controller upgrade. Nodes at SiteA are halted and stopped at the `LOADER` prompt.

== Remove AFF A700 platform controller module and NVS
.About this task
If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

.Steps
.	Gather the bootarg values from both nodes at site A: `printenv`

.	Power off the chassis at site A.

=== Remove the AFF A700 controller module
Use the following procedure to remove the AFF A700 controller module

.Steps
.	Detach the console cable, if any, and the management cable from the controller module before removing the controller module.
.	Unlock and remove the controller module from the chassis.
..	Slide the orange button on the cam handle downward until it unlocks. [*Image to be added here*]
.. 	Rotate the cam handle so that it completely disengages the controller module from the chassis, and then slide the controller module out of the chassis.
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

=== Remove the AFF A700 NVS module
Use the following procedure to remove the AFF A700 NVS module.

Note: The AFF A700 NVS module NVS module is in slot 6 and is double the height compared to other modules in the system.

.Steps
.	Unlock and remove the NVS from slot 6.
..	Depress the lettered and numbered 'cam' button.
The cam button moves away from the chassis.
..	Rotate the cam latch down until it is in a horizontal position.
The NVS disengages from the chassis and moves a few inches.
..	Remove the NVS from the chassis by pulling on the pull tabs on the sides of the module face. [*Image to be inserted here*]
.	If you are using add-on modules used as coredump devices on the AFF A700 NVS, do not transfer them to the AFF A900 NVS.
Do not transfer any parts from the AFF A700 controller module and NVS to the AFF A900.

== Install the AFF A900 NVS and controller modules
You must install the AFF A900 NVS and controller module that you received in the upgrade kit on both nodes at site A. Do not move the coredump device from the AFF A700 NVS module to the AFF A900 NVS module.

.About this task
If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

=== Install the AFF A900 NVS
Use the following procedure to install the AFF A900 NVS in slot 6 of both nodes at site A.

.Steps
.	Align the NVS with the edges of the chassis opening in slot 6.
.	Gently slide the NVS into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin, and then push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the NVS in place. [*image to be added here*]

=== Install the AFF A900 controller module.
Use the following procedure to install the AFF A900 controller module.

.Steps
.	Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
.	Firmly push the controller module into the chassis until it meets the midplane and is fully seated.
The locking latch rises when the controller module is fully seated.
Attention: To avoid damaging the connectors, do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis.
.	Cable the management and console ports to the controller module. [*image to be added here*]

. Install the second X91146A card in slot 7 of each node.
..	Move the e5b connection to e7b.
..	Move the e5a connection to e5b.
Note: Slot 7 on all nodes of the cluster should be empty as mentioned in <<Map ports from the old nodes to the new nodes>> section.
.	Power ON the chassis and connect to serial console.
.	After BIOS initialization, if the node starts autoboot, interrupt the AUTOBOOT by pressing Control-C.
.	After autoboot is interrupted, the nodes stop at the LOADER prompt. If you do not interrupt autoboot on time and node1 starts booting, wait for the prompt to press Ctrl-C to go into the boot menu. After the node stops at the boot menu, use option 8 to reboot the node and interrupt the autoboot during reboot.
.	At the LOADER prompt, set the default environment variables:
set-defaults
.	Save the default environment variables settings:
`saveenv`





=== Netboot nodes at Site A

After swapping the AFF A900 controller module and NVS, you need to `netboot` the AFF A900 nodes and install the same ONTAP version and patch level that is running on the cluster. The term `netboot` means you are booting from an ONTAP image stored on a remote server. When preparing for `netboot`, you must add a copy of the ONTAP 9 boot image onto a web server that the system can access.
It is not possible to check the version of ONTAP installed on the boot media of an AFF A900 controller module unless it is installed in a chassis and powered ON. The ONTAP version on the AFF A900 boot media must be the same as the ONTAP version running on the AFF A700 system that is being upgraded and both the primary and backup boot images should match. You can configure the images by performing a `neboot` followed by the `wipeconfig` command from the boot menu. If the controller module was previously used in another cluster, the `wipeconfig` command clears any residual configuration on the boot media.

.Before you start
* Verify that you can access a HTTP server with the system.
* You need to download the necessary system files for your system and the correct version of ONTAP from the NetApp Support Site.

.About this task
You must netboot the new controllers, if the version of ONTAP installed is not the same as the version installed on the original controllers. After you install each new controller, you boot the system from the ONTAP 9 image stored on the web server. You can then download the correct files to the boot media device for subsequent system boots.


.Steps
. Access the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp Support Site^] to download the files used for performing the netboot of the system.
. Download the appropriate ONTAP software from the software download section of the NetApp Support Site and store the `ontap-version_image.tgz` file on a web-accessible directory.
. Change to the web-accessible directory and verify that the files you need are available.
.	Your directory listing should contain <ontap_version>_image.tgz.
.	Configure the netboot connection by choosing one of the following actions.
+
NOTE:	You should use the management port and IP as the netboot connection. Do not use a data LIF IP or a data outage might occur while the upgrade is being performed.
+

Manually configure the connection by using the following command at the boot environment prompt:
`ifconfig e0M -addr=<filer_addr> -mask=<netmask> -gw=<gateway> - dns=<dns_addr> domain=<dns_domain>
<filer_addr>` is the IP address of the storage system. `<netmask> is the network mask of the storage system.
`<gateway> is the gateway for the storage system.
`<dns_addr`` is the IP address of a name server on your network. This parameter is optional.
`<dns_domain> is the Domain Name Service (DNS) domain name. This parameter is optional.
NOTE:	Other parameters might be necessary for your interface. Enter help `ifconfig` at the firmware prompt for details.
|===

.	Perform netboot on node1:
`netboot` `http://<web_server_ip/path_to_web_accessible_directory>/<ontap_version>_image.tgz`
+
The `<path_to_the_web-accessible_directory>` should lead to where you downloaded the `<ontap_version>_image.tgz` *link to Step*.
NOTE:	Do not interrupt the boot.

.	Wait for the node1 now running on the AFF A900 controller module to boot and display the boot menu options as shown below:
+
----
Please choose one of the following:

(1)  Normal Boot.
(2)  Boot without /etc/rc.
(3)  Change password.
(4)  Clean configuration and initialize all disks.
(5)  Maintenance mode boot.
(6)  Update flash from backup config.
(7)  Install new software first.
(8)  Reboot node.
(9)  Configure Advanced Drive Partitioning.
(10) Set Onboard Key Manager recovery secrets.
(11) Configure node for external key management.
Selection (1-11)?
----
.	From the boot menu, select option ``(7) Install new software first.``
This menu option downloads and installs the new ONTAP image to the boot device.
NOTE:	Disregard the following message: `This procedure is not supported for Non-Disruptive Upgrade on an HA pair.` This note applies to nondisruptive ONTAP software upgrades, and not controller upgrades.
+
Always use netboot to update the new node to the desired image. If you use another method to install the image on the new controller, the incorrect image might install. This issue applies to all ONTAP releases.

.	If you are prompted to continue the procedure, enter `y`, and when prompted for the package, enter the URL:
`http://<web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory>/<ontap_version>_image.tgz`
.	Complete the following substeps to reboot the controller module:
..	Enter `n` to skip the backup recovery when you see the following prompt:
`Do you want to restore the backup configuration now? {y|n}`
..	Enter ``y to reboot when you see the following prompt:
`The node must be rebooted to start using the newly installed software. Do you want to reboot now? {y|n}``
The controller module reboots but stops at the boot menu because the boot device was reformatted, and the configuration data needs to be restored.
.	At the prompt, run the `wipeconfig` command to clear any previous configuration on the boot media:
..	When you see the following message, answer `yes`:
`This will delete critical system configuration, including cluster membership.
Warning: do not run this option on a HA node that has been taken over.
Are you sure you want to continue?:``
..	The node reboots to finish the `wipeconfig` and then stops at the boot menu.
.	Select option `5` to go to maintenance mode from the boot menu. Answer `yes` to the prompts until the node stops at maintenance mode and the command prompt *>.



=== Restore the HBA configuration

Depending on the presence and configuration of HBA cards in the controller module, you need to configure them correctly for your site's usage.

.Steps

. In Maintenance mode configure the settings for any HBAs in the system:

.. Check the current settings of the ports:
+
`ucadmin show`

.. Update the port settings as needed.

+

|===

h| If you have this type of HBA and desired mode... h| Use this command...

a|
CNA FC
a|
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator _adapter-name_`
a|
CNA Ethernet
a|
`ucadmin modify -mode cna _adapter-name_`
a|
FC target
a|
`fcadmin config -t target _adapter-name_`
a|
FC initiator
a|
`fcadmin config -t initiator _adapter-name_`
|===

. Exit Maintenance mode:
+
`halt`
+
After you run the command, wait until the node stops at the LOADER prompt.

. Boot the node back into Maintenance mode to enable the configuration changes to take effect:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

. Verify the changes you made:
+

|===

h| If you have this type of HBA... h| Use this command...

a|
CNA
a|
`ucadmin show`
a|
FC
a|
`fcadmin show`
|===


=== Set the HA state on the new controllers and chassis

You must verify the HA state of the controllers and chassis, and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

.Steps

. In Maintenance mode, display the HA state of the controller module and chassis:
+
`ha-config show`
+
The HA state for all components should be `mccip`.

. If the displayed system state of the controller or chassis is not correct, set the HA state:
+
`ha-config modify controller mccip`
+
`ha-config modify chassis mccip`
.	Halt the node: `halt`
+
The node should stop at the `LOADER>` prompt.

.	On each node, check the system date, time, and time zone: `show date`
.	If necessary, set the date in UTC or GMT: `set date <mm/dd/yyyy>`
.	Check the time by using the following command at the boot environment prompt: `show time`
.	If necessary, set the time in UTC or GMT: `set time <hh:mm:ss>`

=== Reassign root aggregate disks

Reassign the root aggregate disks to the new controller module, using the sysids gathered earlier.

.About this task

These steps are performed in Maintenance mode.

.Steps

. Boot the system to Maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

. Display the disks on node_B_1-new from the Maintenance mode prompt:
+
`disk show -a`
+
The command output shows the system ID of the new controller module (1574774970). However, the root aggregate disks are still owned by the old system ID (537403322). This example does not show drives owned by other nodes in the MetroCluster configuration.

=== Boot up the new controllers

You must boot the new controllers, taking care to ensure that the bootarg variables are correct and, if needed, perform the encryption recovery steps.

.Steps

. Halt the new nodes:
+
`halt`
. If external key manager is configured, set the related bootargs:
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.ipaddr _ip-address_`
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.netmask _netmask_`
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.gateway _gateway-address_`
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.interface _interface-id_`
. Check if the partner-sysid is the current:
+
`printenv partner-sysid`
+
If the partner-sysid is not correct, set it:
+
`setenv partner-sysid _partner-sysID_`

. Display the ONTAP boot menu:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
. If root encryption is used, issue the boot menu command for your key management configuration.
+

|===

h| If you are using... h| Issue this command at the boot menu prompt...

a|
Onboard key management
a|
`recover_onboard_keymanager`
a|
External key management
a|
`recover_external_keymanager`
|===

. From the boot menu, select "`(6) Update flash from backup config`".
+
NOTE: Option 6 will reboot the node twice before completing.

+
Respond `y` to the system id change prompts. Wait for the second reboot messages:
+
----
Successfully restored env file from boot media...

Rebooting to load the restored env file...
----

. On LOADER, double-check the bootarg values and update the values as needed.
+
Use the steps in link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Setting the MetroCluster IP bootarg variables].

. Double-check that the partner-sysid is the correct:
+
`printenv partner-sysid`
+
If the partner-sysid is not correct, set it:
+
`setenv partner-sysid _partner-sysID_`

. If root encryption is used, again issue the boot menu command for your key management configuration.
+

|===

h| If you are using... h| Issue this command at the boot menu prompt...

a|
Onboard key management
a|
`recover_onboard_keymanager`
a|
External key management
a|
`recover_external_keymanager`
|===

+
You may need to issue the `recover_xxxxxxxx_keymanager` command and option 6 at the boot menu prompt multiple times until the nodes fully boot.

. Wait for the replaced nodes to boot up.
+
If either node is in takeover mode, perform a giveback using the `storage failover giveback` command.

. If encryption is used, restore the keys using the correct command for your key management configuration.
+

|===

h| If you are using... h| Use this command...
a|
Onboard key management
a|
`security key-manager onboard sync`

=== Verify and restore LIF configuration

Verify that LIFs are hosted on appropriate nodes and ports as mapped out at the beginning of the upgrade procedure.

.About this tsak

* This task is performed on site_B.
* See the port mapping plan you created in link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Mapping ports from the old nodes to the new nodes].

.Steps

. Verify that LIFs are hosted on the appropriate node and ports prior to switchback.

.. Change to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

.. Override the port configuration to ensure proper LIF placement:
+
`vserver config override -command "network interface modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -home-port _active_port_after_upgrade_ -lif _lif_name_ -home-node _new_node_name_"`
+
When entering the network interface modify command within the `vserver config override` command, you cannot use the tab autocomplete feature. You can create the network `interface modify` using autocomplete and then enclose it in the `vserver config override` command.

.. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`
. Revert the interfaces to their home node:
+
`network interface revert * -vserver _vserver-name_`
+
Perform this step on all SVMs as required.

== Switching back the MetroCluster configuration

In this task, you will perform the switchback operation, and the MetroCluster configuration returns to normal operation. The nodes on site_A are still awaiting upgrade.

image::../media/mcc_upgrade_cluster_a_switchback.png[]

.Steps

. Issue the `metrocluster node show` command on site_B and check the output.
 .. Verify that the new nodes are represented correctly.
 .. Verify that the new nodes are in "Waiting for switchback state."
. Perform the healing and switchback by running the required commands from any node in the active cluster (the cluster that is not undergoing upgrade).
 .. Heal the data aggregates:
 +
`metrocluster heal aggregates`
 .. Heal the root aggregates:
+
`metrocluster heal root`
 .. Switchback the cluster:
+
`metrocluster switchback`
. Check the progress of the switchback operation:
+
`metrocluster show`
+
The switchback operation is still in progress when the output displays `waiting-for-switchback`:
+
----

----
+
If a switchback takes a long time to finish, you can check on the status of in-progress baselines by using the `metrocluster config-replication resync-status show` command. This command is at the advanced privilege level.

== Checking the health of the MetroCluster configuration

After upgrading the controller modules you must verify the health of the MetroCluster configuration.

.About this task

This task can be performed on any node in the MetroCluster configuration.

.Steps
. Verify the operation of the MetroCluster configuration:
 .. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is normal:
 +
`metrocluster show`
 .. Perform a MetroCluster check:
 +
`metrocluster check run`
 .. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`metrocluster check show`
. Verify the MetroCluster connectivity and status.
 .. Check the MetroCluster IP connections:
+
`storage iscsi-initiator show`
 .. Check that the nodes are operating:
+
`metrocluster node show`
 .. Check that the MetroCluster IP interfaces are up:
+
`metrocluster configuration-settings interface show`
 .. Check that local failover is enabled:
+
`storage failover show`

== Upgrading the nodes on cluster_A

You must repeat the upgrade tasks on cluster_A.

.Steps

. Repeat the steps to upgrade the nodes on cluster_A, beginning with link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Preparing for the upgrade].
+
As you perform the tasks, all example references to the clusters and nodes are reversed. For example, when the example is given to switchover from cluster_A, you will switchover from cluster_B.

== Restoring Tiebreaker or Mediator monitoring

After completing the upgrade of the MetroCluster configuration, you can resume monitoring with the Tiebreaker or Mediator utility.

.Steps

. Restore monitoring if necessary, using the procedure for your configuration.
