Expanding a two-node MetroCluster FC configuration to a four-node MetroCluster FC configuration involves adding a controller to each cluster to form an HA pair at each MetroCluster site, and then refreshing the MetroCluster FC configuration.

.Before you begin

* The nodes must be running ONTAP 9 or later in a MetroCluster FC configuration.
+
This procedure is not supported on earlier versions of ONTAP or in MetroCluster IP configurations.
* If the platforms in your two-node configuration are not supported in ONTAP 9.2 and you plan to upgrade to platforms supported in ONTAP 9.2 _and_ expand to a four-node cluster, you must upgrade the platforms in the two-node configuration _before_ expanding the MetroCluster FC configuration.
* The existing MetroCluster FC configuration must be healthy.
* The equipment you are adding must be supported and meet all of the requirements described in the _Fabric-attached MetroCluster Installation and Configuration Guide_ or the _Stretch Installation and Configuration Guide_.

* You must have available FC switch ports to accommodate the new controllers and any new bridges.
* You need the admin password and access to an FTP or SCP server.

.About this task

* This procedure applies only to MetroCluster FC configurations.
* This procedure is disruptive and takes approximately four hours to complete.
* Before performing this procedure, the MetroCluster FC configuration consists of two single-node clusters:

+
After completing this procedure, the MetroCluster FC configuration consists of two HA pairs, one at each site:

* Both sites must be expanded equally.
+
A MetroCluster configuration cannot consist of an uneven number of nodes.

* This procedure can take over an hour per site, with additional time for tasks such as initializing the disks and netbooting the new nodes.
+
The time to initialize the disks depends on the size of the disks.

* This procedure uses the following workflow:
