= Upgrading controllers in a MetroCluster IP configuration using switchover and switchback (ONTAP 9.8 and later)
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use the MetroCluster switchover operation to provide nondisruptive service to clients while the controller modules on the partner cluster are upgraded. Other components (such as storage shelves or switches) cannot be upgraded as part of this procedure.

== Platforms supported by this procedure

* The platforms must be running ONTAP 9.8 or later.
* The target (new) platform must be a different model than the original platform.

* Platform models with internal shelves are not supported.
* You can only upgrade specific platform models using this procedure in a MetroCluster IP configuration. 
** The following table shows the supported platform model combinations. 
** If the intersection of the *Current platform* row and *Target platform* column is not green, this procedure cannot be used. 
+
Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/concept_choosing_an_upgrade_method_mcc.html[Choosing an upgrade or refresh method] for additional procedures.

NOTE: AFF A320 platform models are not supported for upgrade when using BES-53248 IP switches.

image::../media/supported_controller_upgrades_mccip_sosb.png[]

== About this task

* This procedure applies to controller modules in a MetroCluster IP configuration.
* All controllers in the configuration should be upgraded during the same maintenance period.
+
Operating the MetroCluster configuration with different controller types is not supported outside of this maintenance activity.

* The IP switches must be running a supported firmware version.
* If the new platform has fewer slots than the original system, or if it has fewer or different types of ports, you might need to add an adapter to the new system.
+
For more information, see the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe].

* You will reuse the IP addresses, netmasks, and gateways of the original platforms on the new platforms.
* The following example names are used in this procedure:
 ** site_A
  *** Before upgrade:
   **** node_A_1-old
   **** node_A_2-old
  *** After upgrade:
   **** node_A_1-new
   **** node_A_2-new
 ** site_B
  *** Before upgrade:
   **** node_B_1-old
   **** node_B_2-old
  *** After upgrade:
   **** node_B_1-new
   **** node_B_2-new

== Workflow for upgrading controllers in an MetroCluster IP configuration

You can use the workflow diagram to help you plan the upgrade tasks.

image::../media/workflow_ip_upgrade.png[]

== Preparing for the upgrade

Before making any changes to the existing MetroCluster configuration, you must check the health of the configuration, prepare the new platforms, and perform other miscellaneous tasks.

=== Updating the MetroCluster switch RCF files before upgrading controllers

Depending on the old platform models, or if switch configuration is not on the minimum version, or if you want to change VLAN IDs used by the back-end MetroCluster connections, you must update the switch RCF files before you begin the platform upgrade procedure.

.About this task

You must update the RCF file in the following scenarios:

* For certain platform models, the switches must be using a supported VLAN ID for the back-end MetroCluster IP connections. If the old or new platform models are in the following table, *and not* using a supported VLAN ID, you must update the switch RCF files.
+
NOTE: The local cluster connections can use any VLAN, they do not need to be in the given range.
+

|===

h| Platform model (old or new) h| Supported VLAN IDs

a|

 ** AFF A400

a|

 ** 10
 ** 20
 ** Any value in the range 101 to 4096 inclusive.

|===

* The switch configuration was not configured with minimum supported RCF version:
+

|===

h| Switch model h| Required RCF file version

a|
Cisco 3132Q-V
a|
1.7 or later
a|
Cisco 3232C
a|
1.7 or later
a|
Broadcom BES-53248
a|
1.3 or later
|===

* You want to change the VLAN configuration.
+
The VLAN ID range is 101 to 4096 inclusive.

The switches at site_A will be upgraded when the controllers on site_A are upgraded.

.Steps

. Prepare the IP switches for the application of the new RCF files.
+
Follow the steps in the section for your switch vendor from the link:../install-ip/concept_considerations_differences.html[MetroCluster IP installation and configuration].


 ** link:../install-ip/task_switch_config_broadcom.html[Resetting the Broadcom IP switch to factory defaults]
 ** link:../install-ip/task_switch_config_cisco.html[Resetting the Cisco IP switch to factory defaults]

. Download and install the RCF files.
+

=== Mapping ports from the old nodes to the new nodes

You must verify that the physical ports on node_A_1-old map correctly to the physical ports on node_A_1-new, which will allow node_A_1-new to communicate with other nodes in the cluster and with the network after the upgrade.

.About this task

When the new node is first booted during the upgrade process, it will replay the most recent configuration of the old node it is replacing. When you boot node_A_1-new, ONTAP attempts to host LIFs on the same ports that were used on node_A_1-old. Therefore, as part of the upgrade you must adjust the port and LIF configuration so it is compatible with that of the old node. During the upgrade procedure, you will perform steps on both the old and new nodes to ensure correct cluster, management, and data LIF configuration.

The following table shows examples of configuration changes related to the port requirements of the new nodes.

|===

3+h| Cluster interconnect physical ports
h| Old controller h| New controller h| Required action

a|
e0a, e0b

a|
e3a, e3b

a|
No matching port. After upgrade, you must recreate cluster ports.

a|
e0c, e0d

a|
e0a,e0b,e0c,e0d

a|
e0c and e0d are matching ports. You do not have to change the configuration, but after upgrade you can spread your cluster LIFs across the available cluster ports.

|===

.Steps
. Determine what physical ports are available on the new controllers and what LIFs can be hosted on the ports.
+
The controller's port usage depends on the platform module and which switches you will use in the MetroCluster IP configuration. You can gather the port usage of the new platforms from the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe].

. Plan your port usage and fill in the following tables for reference for each of the new nodes.
+
You will refer to the table as you carry out the upgrade procedure.

=== Netbooting the new controllers

After you install the new nodes, you need to netboot to ensure the new nodes are running the same version of ONTAP as the original nodes. The term netboot means you are booting from an ONTAP image stored on a remote server. When preparing for netboot, you must put a copy of the ONTAP 9 boot image onto a web server that the system can access.

.Steps

. Netboot the new controllers:
 .. Access the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp Support Site] to download the files used for performing the netboot of the system.
 .. Download the appropriate ONTAP software from the software download section of the NetApp Support Site and store the `ontap-version_image.tgz` file on a web-accessible directory.
 .. Change to the web-accessible directory and verify that the files you need are available.
+

|===

h| If the platform model is... h| Then...

a|
FAS/AFF8000 series systems
a|
Extract the contents of the `__ontap-version___image.tgz` file to the target directory:

`tar -zxvf __ontap-version___image.tgz`

NOTE: If you are extracting the contents on Windows, use 7-Zip or WinRAR to extract the netboot image. Your directory listing should contain a netboot folder with a kernel file:netboot/kernel

Your directory listing should contain a netboot folder with a kernel file:

`netboot/kernel`

a|
All other systems
a|
Your directory listing should contain a netboot folder with a kernel file:

`_ontap-version_image.tgz`

You do not need to extract the `_ontap-version_image.tgz` file.

|===

.. At the LOADER prompt, configure the netboot connection for a management LIF:
+

|===

h| If IP addressing is... h| Then...

a|
DHCP
a|
Configure the automatic connection:

`ifconfig e0M -auto`
a|
Static
a|
Configure the manual connection:

`ifconfig e0M -addr=_ip_addr_ -mask=_netmask_ -gw=_gateway_`
|===

..  Perform the netboot.
+

|===

h| If the platform model is... h| Then...

a|
FAS/AFF8000 series systems
a|
`netboot http://_web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory_/netboot/kernel`
a|
All other systems
a|
`netboot \http://_web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory/ontap-version_image.tgz`
|===

.. From the boot menu, select option **(7) Install new software first** to download and install the new software image to the boot device.
+
Disregard the following message:
+
`"This procedure is not supported for Non-Disruptive Upgrade on an HA pair"`. It applies to nondisruptive upgrades of software, not to upgrades of controllers.

.. If you are prompted to continue the procedure, enter `y`, and when prompted for the package, enter the URL of the image file:
+
`http://__web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory/ontap-version___image.tgz`

.. Enter the user name and password if applicable, or press Enter to continue.

.. Be sure to enter `n` to skip the backup recovery when you see a prompt similar to the following:
+
----
Do you want to restore the backup configuration now? {y|n} **n**
----

.. Reboot by entering `*y*` when you see a prompt similar to the following:
+
----
The node must be rebooted to start using the newly installed software. Do you want to reboot now? {y|n}
----

=== Clearing the configuration on a controller module

// include reference

include::../_include/steps_clear_config_boot_to_maint_mode.adoc[]

// end include reference

=== Verifying MetroCluster health before site upgrade

You must verify the health and connectivity of the MetroCluster configuration prior to performing the upgrade.

.Steps

. Verify the operation of the MetroCluster configuration in ONTAP:
.. Check whether the nodes are multipathed:
 +
`node run -node _node-name_ sysconfig -a`
+
You should issue this command for each node in the MetroCluster configuration.

 .. Verify that there are no broken disks in the configuration:
 +
`storage disk show -broken`
+
You should issue this command on each node in the MetroCluster configuration.

.. Check for any health alerts:
+
`system health alert show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster.

.. Verify the licenses on the clusters:
+
`system license show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster.

.. Verify the devices connected to the nodes:
+
`network device-discovery show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster.

.. Verify that the time zone and time is set correctly on both sites:
+
`cluster date show`
+
You should issue this command on each cluster. You can use the `cluster date` commands to configure the time and time zone.
. Confirm the operational mode of the MetroCluster configuration and perform a MetroCluster check.
 .. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is `normal`:
 +
`metrocluster show`
 .. Confirm that all expected nodes are shown:
 +
`metrocluster node show`
 .. Issue the following command:
+
`metrocluster check run`
 .. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`metrocluster check show`
. Check the MetroCluster cabling with the Config Advisor tool.
 .. Download and run Config Advisor.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[NetApp Downloads: Config Advisor]

 .. After running Config Advisor, review the tool's output and follow the recommendations in the output to address any issues discovered.

=== Gathering information before the upgrade

Before upgrading, you must gather information for each of the nodes, and, if necessary, adjust the network broadcast domains, remove any VLANs and interface groups, and gather encryption information.

.Steps

. Record the physical cabling for each node, labelling cables as needed to allow correct cabling of the new nodes.
. Gather interconnect, port and LIF information for each node.
+
You should gather the output of the following commands for each node:

 ** `metrocluster interconnect show`
 ** `metrocluster configuration-settings connection show`
 ** `network interface show -role cluster,node-mgmt`
 ** `network port show -node node_name -type physical`
 ** `network port vlan show -node _node-name_`
 ** `network port ifgrp show -node _node_name_ -instance`
 ** `network port broadcast-domain show`
 ** `network port reachability show -detail`
 ** `network ipspace show`
 ** `volume show`
 ** `storage aggregate show`
 ** `system node run -node _node-name_ sysconfig -a`
 ** `vserver fcp initiator show`
 ** `storage disk show`
 ** `metrocluster configuration-settings interface show`

. Gather the UUIDs for the site_B (the site whose platforms are currently being upgraded):
+
`metrocluster node show -fields node-cluster-uuid, node-uuid`
+
These values must be configured accurately on the new site_B controller modules to ensure a successful upgrade. Copy the values to a file so that you can copy them into the proper commands later in the upgrade process.
+
The following example shows the command output with the UUIDs:
+
----

. If the MetroCluster nodes are in a SAN configuration, collect the relevant information.
+
You should gather the output of the following commands:

 ** `fcp adapter show -instance`
 ** `fcp interface show -instance`
 ** `iscsi interface show`
 ** `ucadmin show`

. If the root volume is encrypted, collect and save the passphrase used for key-manager:
+
`security key-manager backup show`

. If the MetroCluster nodes are using encryption for volumes or aggregates, copy information about the keys and passphrases.
+
For additional information, see https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.pow-nve/GUID-1677AE0A-FEF7-45FA-8616-885AA3283BCF.html[Backing up onboard key management information manually].

 .. If Onboard Key Manager is configured:
 +
`security key-manager onboard show-backup`
+
You will need the passphrase later in the upgrade procedure.

 .. If enterprise key management (KMIP) is configured, issue the following commands:
+
`security key-manager external show -instance`
`security key-manager key query`

. Gather the system IDs of the existing nodes:

=== Removing Mediator or Tiebreaker monitoring

Before the upgrading the platforms, you must remove monitoring if the MetroCluster configuration is monitored with the Tiebreaker or Mediator utility.

.Steps

. Collect the output for the following command:
+
`storage iscsi-initiator show`

. Remove the existing MetroCluster configuration from Tiebreaker, Mediator, or other software that can initiate switchover.

=== Sending a custom AutoSupport message prior to maintenance

Before performing the maintenance, you should issue an AutoSupport message to notify NetApp technical support that maintenance is underway. Informing technical support that maintenance is underway prevents them from opening a case on the assumption that a disruption has occurred.

.About this task

This task must be performed on each MetroCluster site.

.Steps

. Log in to the cluster.

. Invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the start of the maintenance:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=__maintenance-window-in-hours__`
+
The `maintenance-window-in-hours` parameter specifies the length of the maintenance window, with a maximum of 72 hours. If the maintenance is completed before the time has elapsed, you can invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the end of the maintenance period:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`

. Repeat these steps on the partner site.

== Switching over the MetroCluster configuration

You must switch over the configuration to site_A so that the platforms on site_B can be upgraded.

.About this task

This task must be performed on site_A.

After completing this task, cluster_A is active and serving data for both sites. cluster_B is inactive, and ready to begin the upgrade process.

image::../media/mcc_upgrade_cluster_a_in_switchover.png[]

.Steps

. Switch over the MetroCluster configuration to site_A so that site_B's nodes can be upgraded:

.. Issue the following command on cluster_A:
+
`metrocluster switchover -controller-replacement true`
+
The operation can take several minutes to complete.

.. Monitor the switchover operation:
+
`metrocluster operation show`

.. After the operation is complete, confirm that the nodes are in switchover state:
+
`metrocluster show`

.. Check the status of the MetroCluster nodes:
+
`metrocluster node show`
+
Automatic healing of aggregates after negotiated switchover is disabled during controller upgrade.

== Removing interface configurations and uninstalling the old controllers

You must move data LIFs to a common port, remove VLANs and interface groups on the old controllers and then physically uninstall the controllers.

.About this task

* These steps are performed on the old controllers (node_B_1-old, node_B_2-old).

* See the information you gathered in link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Mapping ports from the old nodes to the new nodes].

.Steps

. Boot the old nodes and log in to the nodes:
+
`boot_ontap`

. Assign the home port of all data LIFs on the old controller to a common port that is the same on both the old and new controller modules.

.. Display the LIFs:
+
`network interface show`
+
All data LIFS including SAN and NAS will be admin up and operationally down since those are up at switchover site (cluster_A).

 .. Review the output to find a common physical network port that is the same on both the old and new controllers that is not used as a cluster port.
+
For example, e0d is a physical port on old controllers and is also present on new controllers. e0d is not used as a cluster port or otherwise on the new controllers.
+
For port usage for platform models, see the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe]

.. Modify all data LIFS to use the common port as the home port:
 +
`network interface modify -vserver _svm-name_ -lif _data-lif_ -home-port _port-id_`
+
In the following example, this is "e0d".
+
For example:
+
----
network interface modify -vserver vs0 -lif datalif1 -home-port e0d
----
. Remove any VLAN ports using cluster ports as member ports and ifgrps using cluster ports as member ports.
 .. Delete VLAN ports:
 +
`network port vlan delete -node _node-name_ -vlan-name _portid-vlandid_`
+
For example:
+
----
network port vlan delete -node node1 -vlan-name e1c-80
----

.. Remove physical ports from the interface groups:
+
`network port ifgrp remove-port -node _node-name_ -ifgrp _interface-group-name_ -port _portid_`
+
For example:
+
----
network port ifgrp remove-port -node node1 -ifgrp a1a -port e0d
----

.. Remove VLAN and interface group ports from broadcast domain::
+
`network port broadcast-domain remove-ports -ipspace _ipspace_ -broadcast-domain _broadcast-domain-name_ -ports _nodename:portname,nodename:portname_,..`

.. Modify interface group ports to use other physical ports as member as needed.:
+
`ifgrp add-port -node _node-name_ -ifgrp _interface-group-name_ -port _port-id_`

. Halt the nodes to the LOADER prompt:
+
`halt -inhibit-takeover true`

. Connect to the serial console of the old controllers (node_B_1-old and node_B_2-old) at site_B and verify it is displaying the LOADER prompt.

. Gather the bootarg values:
+
`printenv`

. Disconnect the storage and network connections on node_B_1-old and node_B_2-old and label the cables so they can be reconnected to the new nodes.
. Disconnect the power cables from node_B_1-old and node_B_2-old.
. Remove the node_B_1-old and node_B_2-old controllers from the rack.

== Updating the switch RCFs to accommodate the new platforms

You must update the switches to a configuration that supports the new platform models.

.About this task

You perform this task at the site containing the controllers that are currently being upgraded. In the examples shown in this procedure we are upgrading site_B first.

The switches at site_A will be upgraded when the controllers on site_A are upgraded.

== Configuring the new controllers

You must rack and install the controllers, perform required setup in Maintenance mode, and then boot the controllers, and verify the LIF configuration on the controllers.

=== Setting up the new controllers

You must rack and cable the new controllers.

.Steps

. Plan out the positioning of the new controller modules and storage shelves as needed.
+
The rack space depends on the platform model of the controller modules, the switch types, and the number of storage shelves in your configuration.

. Properly ground yourself.

. Install the controller modules in the rack or cabinet.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/platstor/index.jsp[AFF and FAS Documentation Center]

. Cable the controllers to the IP switches as described in link:../install-ip/concept_considerations_differences.html[MetroCluster IP installation and configuration].

** link:[Cabling the IP switches]

. Power up the new nodes and boot them to Maintenance mode.

=== Restoring the HBA configuration

Depending on the presence and configuration of HBA cards in the controller module, you need to configure them correctly for your site's usage.

.Steps

. In Maintenance mode configure the settings for any HBAs in the system:

.. Check the current settings of the ports:
+
`ucadmin show`

.. Update the port settings as needed.

+

|===

h| If you have this type of HBA and desired mode... h| Use this command...

a|
CNA FC
a|
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator _adapter-name_`
a|
CNA Ethernet
a|
`ucadmin modify -mode cna _adapter-name_`
a|
FC target
a|
`fcadmin config -t target _adapter-name_`
a|
FC initiator
a|
`fcadmin config -t initiator _adapter-name_`
|===

. Exit Maintenance mode:
+
`halt`
+
After you run the command, wait until the node stops at the LOADER prompt.

. Boot the node back into Maintenance mode to enable the configuration changes to take effect:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

. Verify the changes you made:
+

|===

h| If you have this type of HBA... h| Use this command...

=== Setting the HA state on the new controllers and chassis

You must verify the HA state of the controllers and chassis, and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

.Steps

. In Maintenance mode, display the HA state of the controller module and chassis:
+
`ha-config show`
+
The HA state for all components should be "`mccip`".

. If the displayed system state of the controller or chassis is not correct, set the HA state:
+
`ha-config modify controller mccip`
+
`ha-config modify chassis mccip`

=== Setting the MetroCluster IP bootarg variables

Certain MetroCluster IP bootarg values must be configured on the new controller modules. The values must match those configured on the old controller modules.

.About this task

In this task, you will use the UUIDs and system IDs identified earlier in the upgrade procedure in link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Gathering information before the upgrade].

.Steps

. If the nodes being upgraded are AFF A400, FAS8300, or FAS8700 models, set the following bootargs at the LOADER prompt:

=== Reassigning root aggregate disks

Reassign the root aggregate disks to the new controller module, using the sysids gathered earlier.

.About this task

These steps are performed in Maintenance mode.

.Steps

. Boot the system to Maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

. Display the disks on node_B_1-new from the Maintenance mode prompt:

=== Booting up the new controllers

You must boot the new controllers, taking care to ensure that the bootarg variables are correct and, if needed, perform the encryption recovery steps.

.Steps

. Halt the new nodes:
+
`halt`
. If external key manager is configured, set the related bootargs:
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.ipaddr _ip-address_`
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.netmask _netmask_`
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.gateway _gateway-address_`
+
`setenv bootarg.kmip.init.interface _interface-id_`
. Check if the partner-sysid is the current:
+
`printenv partner-sysid`
+
If the partner-sysid is not correct, set it:
+
`setenv partner-sysid _partner-sysID_`

. Display the ONTAP boot menu:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
. If root encryption is used, select the boot menu option for your key management configuration.
+

|===

h| If you are using... h| Select this boot menu option...

a|
Onboard key management
a|
Option `10`

Follow the prompts to provide the required inputs to recover and restore the key-manager configuration.
a|
External key management
a|
Option `11`

Follow the prompts to provide the required inputs to recover and restore the key-manager configuration.
|===

. From the boot menu, select "`(6) Update flash from backup config`".
+
NOTE: Option 6 will reboot the node twice before completing.

+
Respond "`y`" to the system id change prompts. Wait for the second reboot messages:
+
----
Successfully restored env file from boot media...

Rebooting to load the restored env file...
----

. On LOADER, double-check the bootarg values and update the values as needed.
+
Use the steps in link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Setting the MetroCluster IP bootarg variables].

. Double-check that the partner-sysid is the correct:
+
`printenv partner-sysid`
+
If the partner-sysid is not correct, set it:
+
`setenv partner-sysid _partner-sysID_`

. If root encryption is used, select the boot menu option again for your key management configuration.
+
|===

h| If you are using... h| Select this boot menu option...

a|
Onboard key management
a|
Option `10`

Follow the prompts to provide the required inputs to recover and restore the key-manager configuration.
a|
External key management
a|
Option "`11`"

Follow the prompts to provide the required inputs to recover and restore the key-manager configuration.
|===
+
Depending on the key manager setting, perform the recovery procedure by selecting option "`10`" or option "`11`", followed by option `6` at the first boot menu prompt. To boot the nodes completely, you might need to repeat the recovery procedure continued by option "`1`" (normal boot).

. Wait for the replaced nodes to boot up.
+
If either node is in takeover mode, perform a giveback using the `storage failover giveback` command.

. If encryption is used, restore the keys using the correct command for your key management configuration.
+

=== Verifying and restoring LIF configuration

Verify that LIFs are hosted on appropriate nodes and ports as mapped out at the beginning of the upgrade procedure.

.About this tsak

* This task is performed on site_B.
* See the port mapping plan you created in link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Mapping ports from the old nodes to the new nodes].

.Steps

. Verify that LIFs are hosted on the appropriate node and ports prior to switchback.

.. Change to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

.. Override the port configuration to ensure proper LIF placement:
+
`vserver config override -command "network interface modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -home-port _active_port_after_upgrade_ -lif _lif_name_ -home-node _new_node_name_"`
+
When entering the network interface modify command within the `vserver config override` command, you cannot use the tab autocomplete feature. You can create the network `interface modify` using autocomplete and then enclose it in the `vserver config override` command.

.. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`
. Revert the interfaces to their home node:
+
`network interface revert * -vserver _vserver-name_`
+
Perform this step on all SVMs as required.

== Switching back the MetroCluster configuration

In this task, you will perform the switchback operation, and the MetroCluster configuration returns to normal operation. The nodes on site_A are still awaiting upgrade.

image::../media/mcc_upgrade_cluster_a_switchback.png[]

.Steps

. Issue the `metrocluster node show` command on site_B and check the output.
 .. Verify that the new nodes are represented correctly.
 .. Verify that the new nodes are in "Waiting for switchback state."
. Perform the healing and switchback by running the required commands from any node in the active cluster (the cluster that is not undergoing upgrade).
 .. Heal the data aggregates:
 +
`metrocluster heal aggregates`
 .. Heal the root aggregates:
+
`metrocluster heal root`
 .. Switchback the cluster:
+
`metrocluster switchback`
. Check the progress of the switchback operation:
+
`metrocluster show`
+
The switchback operation is still in progress when the output displays `waiting-for-switchback`:

If a switchback takes a long time to finish, you can check on the status of in-progress baselines by using the `metrocluster config-replication resync-status show` command. This command is at the advanced privilege level.

== Checking the health of the MetroCluster configuration

After upgrading the controller modules you must verify the health of the MetroCluster configuration.

.About this task

This task can be performed on any node in the MetroCluster configuration.

.Steps
. Verify the operation of the MetroCluster configuration:
 .. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is normal:
 +
`metrocluster show`
 .. Perform a MetroCluster check:
 +
`metrocluster check run`
 .. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`metrocluster check show`
. Verify the MetroCluster connectivity and status.
 .. Check the MetroCluster IP connections:
+
`storage iscsi-initiator show`
 .. Check that the nodes are operating:
+
`metrocluster node show`
 .. Check that the MetroCluster IP interfaces are up:
+
`metrocluster configuration-settings interface show`
 .. Check that local failover is enabled:
+
`storage failover show`

== Upgrading the nodes on cluster_A

You must repeat the upgrade tasks on cluster_A.

.Steps

. Repeat the steps to upgrade the nodes on cluster_A, beginning with link:task_upgrade_controllers_in_a_four_node_ip_mcc_us_switchover_and_switchback_mcc_ip.html[Preparing for the upgrade].
+
As you perform the tasks, all example references to the clusters and nodes are reversed. For example, when the example is given to switchover from cluster_A, you will switchover from cluster_B.

== Restoring Tiebreaker or Mediator monitoring

After completing the upgrade of the MetroCluster configuration, you can resume monitoring with the Tiebreaker or Mediator utility.

.Steps

. Restore monitoring if necessary, using the procedure for your configuration.

== Sending a custom AutoSupport message after maintenance

After completing the upgrade, you should send an AutoSupport message indicating the end of maintenance, so automatic case creation can resume.

.Steps

. To resume automatic support case generation, send an Autosupport message to indicate that the maintenance is complete.
 .. Issue the following command:
 +
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`
 .. Repeat the command on the partner cluster.
