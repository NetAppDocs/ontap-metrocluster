.Steps

. Switch over the MetroCluster configuration to site_A so that site_B's nodes can be upgraded:

.. Issue the following command on cluster_A:
+
`metrocluster switchover -controller-replacement true`
+
The operation can take several minutes to complete.

.. Monitor the switchover operation:
+
`metrocluster operation show`

.. After the operation is complete, confirm that the nodes are in switchover state:
+
`metrocluster show`

.. Check the status of the MetroCluster nodes:
+
`metrocluster node show`
+
Automatic healing of aggregates after negotiated switchover is disabled during controller upgrade.
