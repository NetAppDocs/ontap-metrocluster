You must set the partner system ID on both controller modules so that they can form an HA pair.

This task is performed with both controller modules at the LOADER prompt.

. On the existing controller module, set the partner system ID to that of the new controller module: `setenv partner-sysid sysID_of_new_controller`
. On the new controller module, set the partner system ID to that of the existing controller module: `setenv partner-sysid sysID_of_existing_controller`
