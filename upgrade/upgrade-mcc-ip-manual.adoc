[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use the MetroCluster switchover operation to provide nondisruptive service to clients while the controller modules on the partner cluster are upgraded. Other components (such as storage shelves or switches) cannot be upgraded as part of this procedure.

.About this workflow

You can use this workflow to upgrade MetroCluster IP controllers using switchover and switchback on systems running ONTAP 9.8 or later.
