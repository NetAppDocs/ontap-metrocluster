You should issue an AutoSupport message to notify NetApp technical support that maintenance is complete.

This task must be performed on each MetroCluster site.

. Log in to the cluster at Site_A.
. Invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the end of the maintenance: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`
. Repeat this step on the partner site.
