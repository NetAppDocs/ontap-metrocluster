Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can remove a DR group from an eight-node MetroCluster configuration to create a four-node MetroCluster configuration.

This procedure is supported on ONTAP 9.8 and later. For systems running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, see the Knowledge Base article

link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/MetroCluster/How_to_remove_a_DR-Group_from_a_MetroCluster[How to remove a DR group from a MetroCluster configuration]

https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support]

An eight-node configuration includes eight-nodes organized as two four-node DR groups.

By removing a DR Group, four nodes remain in the configuration.

== Removing the DR group nodes from each cluster

* You must perform this step on both clusters.
* The `metrocluster remove-dr-group` command is supported only on ONTAP 9.8 and later.

. Prepare for the removal of the DR group, if you haven't already.
 .. Move all data volumes to another DR group.
 .. Move all MDV_CRS metadata volumes to another DR group. Follow the steps in the following procedure: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/task_move_a_metadata_volume_in_mcc_configurations.html[Moving a metadata volume in MetroCluster configurations]
 .. Delete all MDV_aud metadata volumes that might exist in the DR group to be removed.
 .. Delete all data aggregates in the DR group to be removed as shown in the following example:
+
----
ClusterA::> storage aggregate show -node ClusterA-01, ClusterA-02 -fields aggregate ,node
ClusterA::> aggr delete -aggregate aggregate_name
ClusterB::> storage aggregate show -node ClusterB-01, ClusterB-02 -fields aggregate ,node
ClusterB::> aggr delete -aggregate aggregate_name
----
+
NOTE: Root aggregates are not deleted.

 .. Move the data LIFs offline.
 `network interface modify -vserver _svm-name_ -lif _data-lif_ -status-admin down`

 .. Migrate all data LIFs to home nodes in another DR group.
 +
`network interface show -home-node _old_node_`
+
`network interface modify -vserver _svm-name_ -lif _data-lif_ -home-node _new_node_ -home-port _port-id_`

 .. Move the data LIFs back online.
 `network interface modify -vserver _svm-name_ -lif _data-lif_ -status-admin up`

 .. Migrate the cluster management LIF to a home node in another DR group.
+
`network interface show -role cluster-mgmt`
+
`network interface modify -vserver _svm-name_ -lif _cluster_mgmt_ -home-node _new_node_ -home-port _port-id_`
+
Node management and inter-cluster LIFs are not migrated.

.. Transfer epsilon to a node in another DR group if required.
+
----
ClusterA::> set advanced
ClusterA::*> cluster show
Move epsilon if needed
ClusterA::*> cluster modify -node nodename -epsilon false
ClusterA::*> cluster modify -node nodename -epsilon true

ClusterB::> set advanced
ClusterB::*> cluster show
ClusterB::*> cluster modify -node nodename -epsilon false
ClusterB::*> cluster modify -node nodename -epsilon true
ClusterB::*> set admin
----
. Identify and remove the DR group.
.. Identify the correct DR group for removal:
+
`metrocluster node show`
.. Remove the DR group nodes:
 +
`metrocluster remove-dr-group -dr-group-id 1`
+
The following example shows the removal of the DR group configuration on cluster_A.

cluster_A::*>

Warning: Nodes in the DR group that are removed from the MetroCluster
         configuration will lose their disaster recovery protection.

         Local nodes "node_A_1-FC, node_A_2-FC"will be removed from the
         MetroCluster configuration. You must repeat the operation on the
         partner cluster "cluster_B"to remove the remote nodes in the DR group.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y

Info: The following preparation steps must be completed on the local and partner
      clusters before removing a DR group.

      1. Move all data volumes to another DR group.
      2. Move all MDV_CRS metadata volumes to another DR group.
      3. Delete all MDV_aud metadata volumes that may exist in the DR group to
      be removed.
      4. Delete all data aggregates in the DR group to be removed. Root
      aggregates are not deleted.
      5. Migrate all data LIFs to home nodes in another DR group.
      6. Migrate the cluster management LIF to a home node in another DR group.
      Node management and inter-cluster LIFs are not migrated.
      7. Transfer epsilon to a node in another DR group.

      The command is vetoed if the preparation steps are not completed on the
      local and partner clusters.

[Job 513] Job succeeded: Remove DR Group is successful.

. Repeat the previous step on the partner cluster.
. If in a MetroCluster IP configuration, remove the MetroCluster connections on the nodes of the old DR group.
+
These commands can be issued from either cluster and apply to the entire DR group spanning both the clusters.

.. Disconnect the connections:
+
`metrocluster configuration-settings connection disconnect _dr-group-id_`
.. Delete the MetroCluster interfaces on the nodes of the old DR group:
+
`metrocluster configuration-settings interface delete`
.. Delete the old DR group's configuration.
 +
`metrocluster configuration-settings dr-group delete`

. Unjoin the nodes in the old DR group.
+
You must perform this step on each cluster.

.. Set the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
.. Disable the storage failover:
+
`storage failover modify -node _node-name_ -enable false`
// BURT 1419399, 2021-11-18
.. Unjoin the node:
 +
`cluster unjoin -node _node-name_`
+
Repeat this step for the other local node in the old DR group.

.. Set the admin privilege level:
 +
`set -privilege admin`

. Re-enable cluster HA in the new DR group:
+
`cluster ha modify -configured true`
+
You must perform this step on each cluster.

. Halt, power down, and remove the old controller modules and storage shelves.
