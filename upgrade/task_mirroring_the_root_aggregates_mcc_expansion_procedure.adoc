You must mirror the root aggregate to provide data protection when you are adding a controller to a MetroCluster configuration.

This task must be performed on the new controller module.

. Mirror the root aggregate: `storage aggregate mirror aggr_name`
+
The following command mirrors the root aggregate for controller_A_1:
+
----
controller_A_1::> storage aggregate mirror aggr0_controller_A_1
----
+
This mirrors the aggregate, so it consists of a local plex and a remote plex located at the remote MetroCluster site.
