You must mirror the root aggregates to provide data protection.

By default, the root aggregate is created as RAID-DP type aggregate. You can change the root aggregate from RAID-DP to RAID4 type aggregate. The following command modifies the root aggregate for RAID4 type aggregate:

----
storage aggregate modify â€“aggregate aggr_name -raidtype raid4
----

NOTE: On non-ADP systems, the RAID type of the aggregate can be modified from the default RAID-DP to RAID4 before or after the aggregate is mirrored.

. Mirror the root aggregate: `storage aggregate mirror aggr_name`
+
The following command mirrors the root aggregate for controller_A_1:
+
----
controller_A_1::> storage aggregate mirror aggr0_controller_A_1
----
+
This mirrors the aggregate, so it consists of a local plex and a remote plex located at the remote MetroCluster site.

. Repeat the previous step for each node in the MetroCluster configuration.
