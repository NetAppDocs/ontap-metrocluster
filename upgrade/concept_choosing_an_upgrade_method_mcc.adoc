[.lead]
The upgrade or refresh procedure you use depends on the platform model, scope of the upgrade, and type of MetroCluster configuration.

There are different types of upgrade and refresh procedures.

* Upgrade procedures apply only to the controller modules. The controllers are replaced with a new controller model.
+
The storage shelf models are not upgraded.

** In switchover and switchback procedures, the MetroCluster switchover operation is used to provide nondisruptive service to clients while the controller modules on the partner cluster are upgraded.
** In an ARL-based controller upgrade procedure, the aggregate relocation operations are used to nondisruptively move data from the old configuration to the new, upgraded configuration.

* Refresh procedures apply to the controllers and the storage shelves.
+
In the refresh procedures, new controllers and shelves are added to the MetroCluster configuration, creating a second DR group, and then data is nondisruptively migrated to the new nodes.
+
The original controllers are then retired.

== Supported platforms combinations for controller upgrade

You can upgrade certain platforms using aggregate relocation.
The following table shows which controller upgrade combinations are supported:
