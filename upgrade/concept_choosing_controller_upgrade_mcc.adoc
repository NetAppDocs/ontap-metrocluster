[.lead]
The controller upgrade procedure you use depends on the platform model, scope of the upgrade, and type of MetroCluster configuration.

== Supported platform combinations for controller upgrade using switchover and switchback in a MetroCluster FC configuration

* The target (new) platform must be a different model than the original platform.
* Platform models with internal shelves are not supported.
* You can only upgrade specific platform models using this procedure in a MetroCluster FC configuration. 
** The following table shows the supported platform model combinations. 
** If the intersection of the *Current platform* row and *Target platform* column is not green, this procedure cannot be used.

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/concept_choosing_an_upgrade_method_mcc.html[Choosing an upgrade or refresh method] for additional procedures.

NOTE: Upgrading a FAS8020 or AFF8020 is not supported when using 1c and 1d ports in FC-VI mode.


== Supported platform combinations for controller upgrade using switchover and switchback in a MetroCluster FC configuration

* The platforms must be running ONTAP 9.8 or later.
* The target (new) platform must be a different model than the original platform.

* Platform models with internal shelves are not supported.
* You can only upgrade specific platform models using this procedure in a MetroCluster IP configuration. 
** The following table shows the supported platform model combinations. 
** If the intersection of the *Current platform* row and *Target platform* column is not green, this procedure cannot be used.

Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/concept_choosing_an_upgrade_method_mcc.html[Choosing an upgrade or refresh method] for additional procedures.

NOTE: AFF A320 platform models are not supported for upgrade when using BES-53248 IP switches.
