You install and cable ATTO FibreBridge bridges and SAS disk shelves when adding new storage to the configuration.

For systems received from the factory, the FC-to-SAS bridges are preconfigured and do not require additional configuration.

This procedure is written with the assumption that you are using the recommended bridge management interfaces: the ATTO ExpressNAV GUI and ATTO QuickNAV utility.

You use the ATTO ExpressNAV GUI to configure and manage a bridge, and to update the bridge firmware. You use the ATTO QuickNAV utility to configure the bridge Ethernet management 1 port.

You can use other management interfaces instead, if needed, such as a serial port or Telnet to configure and manage a bridge and to configure the Ethernet management 1 port, and FTP to update the bridge firmware.

This procedure uses the following workflow:
