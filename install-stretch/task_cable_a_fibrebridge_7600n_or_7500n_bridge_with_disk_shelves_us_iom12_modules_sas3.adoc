= Cabling a FibreBridge 7600N or 7500N bridge with disk shelves using IOM12 modules

After configuring the bridge, you can start cabling your new system.

For disk shelves, you insert a SAS cable connector with the pull tab oriented down (on the underside of the connector).

.Steps
. Daisy-chain the disk shelves in each stack:
 .. Beginning with the logical first shelf in the stack, connect IOM A port 3 to the next shelf's IOM A port 1 until each IOM A in the stack is connected.
 .. Repeat the previous substep for IOM B.
 .. Repeat the previous substeps for each stack.

+
The _Installation and Service Guide_ for your disk shelf model provides detailed information about daisy-chaining disk shelves.
. Power on the disk shelves, and then set the shelf IDs.
 ** You must power-cycle each disk shelf.
 ** Shelf IDs must be unique for each SAS disk shelf within each MetroCluster DR group (including both sites).
. Cable disk shelves to the FibreBridge bridges.
 .. For the first stack of disk shelves, cable IOM A of the first shelf to SAS port A on FibreBridge A, and cable IOM B of the last shelf to SAS port A on FibreBridge B.
 .. For additional shelf stacks, repeat the previous step using the next available SAS port on the FibreBridge bridges, using port B for the second stack, port C for the third stack, and port D for the fourth stack.
 .. During cabling, attach the stacks based on IOM12 and IOM3/IOM6 modules to the same bridge as long as they are connected to separate SAS ports.
+
NOTE: Each stack can use different models of IOM, but all disk shelves within a stack must use the same model.

The following illustration shows disk shelves connected to a pair of FibreBridge 7600N or 7500N bridges:
