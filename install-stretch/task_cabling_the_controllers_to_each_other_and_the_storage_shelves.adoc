The above illustration is representative. The specific FC-VI ports vary by controller module.

 ** FAS8200 and AFF A300 controller modules can be ordered with one of two options for FC-VI connectivity:
  *** Onboard ports 0e and 0f configured in FC-VI mode.
  *** Ports 1a and 1b on an FC-VI card in slot 1.
 ** AFF A700 and FAS9000 storage systems controller modules use four FC-VI ports each.
 ** AFF A400 and FAS8300 storage system controller modules use FC-VI ports 2a and 2b.

. Cable the SAS ports.

The following illustration shows the connections. Your port usage might be different, depending on the available SAS and FC-VI ports on the controller module.
