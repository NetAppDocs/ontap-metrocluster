In a stretch MetroCluster configuration with array LUNs, you must connect the FC-VI ports across controllers. Direct connectivity is supported between the controllers and E-Series storage arrays. For all other array LUN configurations, you must use FC switches in the configuration.

You can also set up a stretch MetroCluster configuration with both disks and array LUNs. In such a configuration, you must use either FC-to-SAS bridges or SAS optical cables to connect the controllers to disks.
