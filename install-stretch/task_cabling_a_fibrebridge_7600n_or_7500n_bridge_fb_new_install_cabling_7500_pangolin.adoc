After configuring the bridge, you can start cabling your new system. The FibreBridge 7600N or 7500N bridge uses mini-SAS connectors and supports shelves that use IOM6 or IOM3 modules.

IOM3 modules are not supported with FibreBridge 7600N bridges.

For disk shelves, you insert a SAS cable connector with the pull tab oriented down (on the underside of the connector).

. Daisy-chain the shelves in each stack.
 .. For the first stack of shelves, cable IOM A square port of the first shelf to SAS port A on FibreBridge A.
 .. For the first stack of shelves, cable IOM B circle port of the last shelf to SAS port A on FibreBridge B.

+
The _Installation and Service Guide_ for your shelf model provides detailed information about daisy-chaining shelves.

. For additional shelf stacks, repeat the previous steps using the next available SAS port on the FibreBridge bridges, using port B for a second stack, port C for a third stack, and port D for a fourth stack.
