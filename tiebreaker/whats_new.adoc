* OS refers to both RedHat and CentOS releases unless otherwise specified.
* "Implied" means that the OS was released after the ONTAP Mediator was shipped, but support has been confirmed.
* "No" means that the OS and ONTAP Mediator are not compatible.
* Centos 8 was removed for all releases due to its rebranching. Centos Stream was deemed as not a suitable production target OS. No support is planned.
* ONTAP Mediator 1.5 was the last supported release for RHEL 7.x branch operating systems.
* ONTAP Mediator 1.6 adds support for Rocky Linux 8 and 9.
