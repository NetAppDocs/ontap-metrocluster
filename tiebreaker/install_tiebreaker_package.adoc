You must install or upgrade the MetroCluster Tiebreaker software on your local computer to monitor MetroCluster configurations.

.About this task
* Your storage system must be running ONTAP 8.3.x or later.
* You must have installed OpenJDK by using the `yum install java-x.x.x-openjdk` command. For systems running Tiebreaker 1.4 and earlier, run JRE 8. For systems running Tiebreaker 1.5 and later, run OpenJDK 17, 18, or 19. The outputs in the example show JRE 1.8.0. (JRE 8).
* You can install MetroCluster Tiebreaker as a non-root user with sufficient administrative privileges to perform the Tiebreaker installation, create tables, users, and set the user password etc.

.Steps
. Download the latest version of the MetroCluster Tiebreaker software. This example uses version 1.5.

. Download the `MetroCluster_Tiebreaker_RPM_GPG` key:
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp Support Site^]

. Log in to the host as the root user.

. Create a non-root user and the `mcctbgrp` group. 
+
.. Create a non-root user and set the password.
+
The following example commands create a non-root user named `mcctbuser1`:
+
---- 
[root@mcctb ~]# useradd mcctbuser1
[root@mcctb ~]# passwd mcctbuser1
Changing password for user mcctbuser1.
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
----
..	Create a group named `mcctbgrp`:
+
`[root@mcctb ~~]# groupadd mcctbgrp`
 
.. Add the non-root user you created to the `mcctbgrp` group.
+
The following command adds `mcctbuser1` to the `mcctbgrp` group:
+
`[root@mcctb ~]# usermod -a -G mcctbgrp mcctbuser1`


. Verify the RPM file. 
+
Run the following substeps from the directory containing the RPM key. 
+
..  Download and import the RPM key file:
+
----
[root@mcctb ~]# rpm --import MetroCluster_Tiebreaker_RPM_GPG.key
----

.. Verify the that the correct key was imported by checking the fingerprint. 
+
The following example shows a correct key fingerprint:
+
----
root@mcctb:~/signing/mcctb-rpms# gpg --show-keys --with-fingerprint MetroCluster_Tiebreaker_RPM_GPG.key
pub   rsa3072 2022-11-17 [SCEA] [expires: 2025-11-16]
      65AC 1562 E28A 1497 7BBD  7251 2855 EB02 3E77 FAE5
uid                      MCCTB-RPM (mcctb RPM production signing) <mcctb-rpm@netapp.com>
----

.. Verify the signature: `rpm --checksig NetApp-MetroCluster-Tiebreaker-Software-1.5-1.x86_64.rpm`
+
----
NetApp-MetroCluster-Tiebreaker-Software-1.5-1.x86_64.rpm: digests OK
----
+
NOTE: You must only proceed with installation after you have successfully verified the signature.

. [[install-tiebreaker]]Install or upgrade the Tiebreaker software: 
+
NOTE: You can only upgrade to Tiebreaker version 1.5 when you are upgrading from Tiebreaker version 1.4. Upgrading from earlier versions to Tiebreaker 1.5 is not supported.
+
Select the correct procedure from below depending on whether you're performing a new installation or upgrading an existing installation.

NOTE: If you enter the wrong MySQL root password, the Tiebreaker software indicates that it was installed successfully, but displays "Access denied" messages. To resolve the issue, you must uninstall the Tiebreaker software by using the `rpm -e` command, and then reinstall the software by using the correct MySQL root password.

. Check the Tiebreaker connectivity to the MetroCluster software by opening an SSH connection from the Tiebreaker host to each of the node management LIFs and cluster management LIFs.
