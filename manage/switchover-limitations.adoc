When the system is in switchover, certain operations should not be performed. Learn about restricted operations when the system is in switchover. 

== Restricted operations in switchover

The following operations are not supported when the system is in switchover:

* Creating or deleting aggregates and volumes 
* Creating or deleting SVMs
* Creating or deleting LIFs
* Adding or removing disks (only if you are replacing them as part of a recovery procedure)
* Performing configuration changes to SnapMirror SVM DR
* Modifying existing broadcast domains or creating new broadcast domains
* Modifying network subnets 

== Hardware replacement in switchover

Use the following procedures to replace controller hardware when the system is in switchover:

* If you need to replace a controller of the same type, at the site not in switchover, follow the procedure to link:../disaster-recovery/task_recover_from_a_multi_controller_and_or_storage_failure.html[Recover from a multi-controller or storage failure].

** If you need to replace the controller modules and chassis while the nodes are switched over at the surviving site, shut down both controllers and then perform the procedure to link:../disaster-recovery/task_recover_from_a_multi_controller_and_or_storage_failure.html[Recover from a multi-controller or storage failure].

* If you need to replace a controller with a different type of controller, follow the procedure for your configuration in link:../upgrade/concept_choosing_controller_upgrade_mcc.html[Choose a controller upgrade procedure].

** If your system is in switchover because of a controller failure or if you experience a controller failure while in switchover, you must first replace the controller hardware, perform a switchback, and then perform a controller upgrade:
+
. To replace the controller hardware and perform the switchback, follow link:../disaster-recovery/task_recover_from_a_multi_controller_and_or_storage_failure.html[Recover from a multi-controller or storage failure].
. After you have replaced the hardware, perform a controller upgrade using the procedures in link:../upgrade/concept_choosing_controller_upgrade_mcc.html[Choose a controller upgrade procedure].
