After a negotiated switchover operation, you must perform the healing operations in specific order to restore MetroCluster functionality. The procedure you use depends on the type of MetroCluster configuration you have.

On MetroCluster IP systems running ONTAP 9.5, healing is performed automatically, and you can skip these tasks.
