[.lead]
After a failure in a MetroCluster configuration, you must select the correct recovery procedure. Use the following table and examples to select the appropriate recovery procedure.

This information in this table assumes that the installation or transition is complete, meaning that the `metrocluster configure` command ran successfully.

|===

h| Scope of failures at disaster site h| Procedure

a|
* No hardware failure (for example, a power failure)

a|
link:task_recover_from_a_non_controller_failure_mcc_dr.html[Recovering from a non-controller failure]
a|

* No controller module failure
* Other hardware has failed

a|
link:task_recover_from_a_non_controller_failure_mcc_dr.html[Recovering from a non-controller failure]
a|

* Single controller module failure or failure of FRU components within the controller module
* Drives have not failed

a|
If a failure is limited to a single controller module, you must use the controller module FRU replacement procedure for the platform model. In a four or eight-node MetroCluster configuration, such a failure is isolated to the local HA pair.

*Note:* The controller module FRU replacement procedure can be used in a two-node MetroCluster configuration if there are no drive or other hardware failures.

* Single controller module failure or failure of FRU components within the controller module
* Drives have failed

a|
link:task_recover_from_a_multi_controller_and_or_storage_failure.html[Recovering from a multi-controller or storage failure]

a|

* Single controller module failure or failure of FRU components within the controller module
* Drives have not failed
* Additional hardware outside the controller module has failed

a|

You should skip all steps for drive assignment.

* Multiple controller module failure (with or without additional failures) within a DR group

== Controller module failure scenarios during MetroCluster installation

Responding to a controller module failure during the MetroCluster configuration procedure depends on whether the `metrocluster configure` command successfully completed.

•	If the `metrocluster configure` command was not yet run, or failed, you must restart the MetroCluster software configuration procedure from the beginning with a replacement controller module.
+
NOTE: You must be sure to perform the steps in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/task_sw_config_restore_defaults.html[Restoring system defaults on a controller module] on each controller (including the replacement controller) to verify that the previous configuration is removed.

•	If the `metrocluster configure` command successfully completed and then the controller module failed, use the previous table to determine the correct recovery procedure.


== Controller module failure scenarios during MetroCluster FC-to-IP transition

The recovery procedure can be used if a site failure occurs during transition. However, it can only be used if the configuration is a stable mixed configuration, with the FC DR group and IP DR group both fully configured. The output of the `metrocluster node show` command should show both DR groups with all eight nodes.

IMPORTANT: If the failure occurred during transition when the nodes are in the process of being added or removed, you must contact technical support.

== Controller module failure scenarios in eight-node MetroCluster configurations

Failure scenarios:

* <<Single controller module failures in a single DR group>>
* <<Two controller module failures in a single DR group>>
* <<Single controller module failures in separate DR groups>>
* <<Three controller module failures spread across the DR groups>>

=== Single controller module failures in a single DR group

In this case the failure is limited to an HA pair.

 ** If no storage requires replacement, you can use the controller module FRU replacement procedure for the platform model.

https://docs.netapp.com/platstor/index.jsp[ONTAP Hardware Systems Documentation^]

 ** If storage requires replacement, you can use the multi-controller module recovery procedure.
+

+
This scenario applies to four-node MetroCluster configurations also.

=== Two controller module failures in a single DR group

In this case the failure requires a switchover. You can use the multi-controller module failure recovery procedure.

link:task_recover_from_a_multi_controller_and_or_storage_failure.html[Recovering from a multi-controller or storage failure]

This scenario applies to four-node MetroCluster configurations also.

image::../media/mcc_dr_groups_8_node_with_a_multi_controller_failure.gif["Eight node MetroCluster DR groups with multi controller failure"]

=== Single controller module failures in separate DR groups

In this case the failure is limited to separate HA pairs.

 ** If no storage requires replacement, you can use the controller module FRU replacement procedure for the platform model.
+
The FRU replacement procedure is performed twice, once for each failed controller module.

 ** If storage requires replacement, you can use the multi-controller module recovery procedure.

image::../media/mcc_dr_groups_8_node_with_two_single_controller_failures.gif["Eight node MetroCluster DR groups with two single controller failures"]

=== Three controller module failures spread across the DR groups

In this case the failure requires a switchover. You can use the multi-controller module failure recovery procedure for DR Group One.

link:task_recover_from_a_multi_controller_and_or_storage_failure.html[Recovering from a multi-controller or storage failure]

You can use the platform-specific controller module FRU replacement procedure for DR Group Two.

image::../media/mcc_dr_groups_8_node_with_a_3_controller_failure.gif["Eight node MetroCluster DR groups with three controller failures"]

== Controller module failure scenarios in two-node MetroCluster configurations

The procedure you use depends on the extent of the failure.

* If no storage requires replacement, you can use the controller module FRU replacement procedure for the platform model.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/platstor/index.jsp[ONTAP Hardware Systems Documentation^]

* If storage requires replacement, you can use the multi-controller module recovery procedure.
