If hardware components have to be replaced, you must replace them using their individual hardware replacement and installation guides.

== Replace hardware at the disaster site

.Before you begin

The storage controllers must be powered off or remain halted (showing the LOADER prompt).

.Steps

. Replace the components as necessary.
+
NOTE: In this step, you replace and cable the components exactly as they were cabled prior to the disaster. You must not power up the components.

+

|===

h| If you are replacing... h| Perform these steps... h| Using these guides...

a|
FC switches in a MetroCluster FC configuration
a|

 .. Install the new switches.
 .. Cable the ISL links.
 Do not power on the FC switches at this time.

a|
IP switches in a MetroCluster IP configuration
a|

 .. Install the new switches.
 .. Cable the ISL links.
 Do not power on the IP switches at this time.

a|
Disk shelves
a|

 .. Install the disk shelves and disks.
  *** Disk shelf stacks should be the same configuration as at the surviving site.
  *** Disks can be the same size or larger, but must be of the same type (SAS or SATA).
 .. Cable the disk shelves to adjacent shelves within the stack and to the FC-to-SAS bridge.
 Do not power on the disk shelves at this time.

a|
FC-to-SAS bridges in a MetroCluster FC configuration
a|

 .. Install the FC-to-SAS bridges.
 .. Cable the FC-to-SAS bridges.
+
Cable them to the FC switches or to the controller modules, depending on your MetroCluster configuration type.

+
Do not power on the FC-to-SAS bridges at this time.

link:../install-stretch/concept_considerations_differences.html[Stretch MetroCluster installation and configuration]
a|
Controller modules
a|

 .. Install the new controller modules:
  *** The controller modules must be the same model as those being replaced.
+
For example, 8080 controller modules must be replaced with 8080 controller modules.

  *** The controller modules must not have previously been part of either cluster within the MetroCluster configuration or any previously existing cluster configuration.
+
If they were, you must set defaults and perform a "`wipeconfig`" process.

  *** Ensure that all network interface cards (such as Ethernet or FC) are in the same slots used on the old controller modules.
 .. Cable the new controller modules exactly the same as the old ones.
+
The ports connecting the controller module to the storage (either by connections to the IP or FC switches, FC-to-SAS bridges, or directly) should be the same as those used prior to the disaster.

+
Do not power on the controller modules at this time.

== Determine the system IDs and VLAN IDs of the old controller modules

After you have replaced all hardware at the disaster site, you must determine the system IDs of the replaced controller modules. You need the old system IDs when you reassign disks to the new controller modules. If the systems are AFF A220, AFF A250, AFF A400, AFF A800, FAS2750, FAS500f, FAS8300, or FAS8700 models, you must also determine the VLAN IDs used by the MetroCluster IP interfaces.

.Before you begin

All equipment at the disaster site must be powered off.

.About this task

This discussion provides examples for two and four-node configurations. For eight-node configurations, you must account for any failures in the additional nodes on the second DR group.

For a two-node MetroCluster configuration, you can ignore references to the second controller module at each site.

The examples in this procedure are based on the following assumptions:

* Site A is the disaster site.
* node_A_1 has failed and is being completely replaced.
* node_A_2 has failed and is being completely replaced.
+
node _A_2 is present in a four-node MetroCluster configuration only.

* Site B is the surviving site.
* node_B_1 is healthy.
* node_B_2 is healthy.
+
node_B_2 is present in a four-node MetroCluster configuration only.

The controller modules have the following original system IDs:


|===

h| Number of nodes in MetroCluster configuration h| Node h| Original system ID

.Steps

. From the surviving site, display the system IDs of the nodes in the MetroCluster configuration.

In this example for a four-node MetroCluster configuration, the following old system IDs are retrieved:
** Node_A_1: 4068741258
** Node_A_2: 4068741260
+
Disks owned by the old controller modules are still owned these system IDs.

== Isolate replacement drives from the surviving site (MetroCluster IP configurations)

You must isolate any replacement drives by taking down the MetroCluster iSCSI initiator connections from the surviving nodes.

.About this task

This procedure is only required on MetroCluster IP configurations.

.Steps

. From either surviving node's prompt, change to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
+
You need to respond with `y` when prompted to continue into advanced mode and see the advanced mode prompt (*>).

. Disconnect the iSCSI initiators on both surviving nodes in the DR group:
+
`storage iscsi-initiator disconnect -node surviving-node -label *`
+
This command must be issued twice, once for each of the surviving nodes.
+
The following example shows the commands for disconnecting the initiators on site B:
+
----
site_B::*> storage iscsi-initiator disconnect -node node_B_1 -label *
site_B::*> storage iscsi-initiator disconnect -node node_B_2 -label *
----

. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`

== Clear the configuration on a controller module

// include reference
include::../_include/steps_clear_config_boot_to_maint_mode.adoc[]
// end include reference

== Netboot the new controller modules

If the new controller modules have a different version of ONTAP from the version on the surviving controller modules, you must netboot the new controller modules.

.Before you begin

* You must have access to an HTTP server.
* You must have access to the NetApp Support Site to download the necessary system files for your platform and version of ONTAP software that is running on it.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support^]

// include file
include::../_include/netboot_steps.adoc[]
// end include file

. From the Boot menu, select *option 5* to enter Maintenance mode.
. If you have a four-node MetroCluster configuration, repeat this procedure on the other new controller module.

== Determine the system IDs of the replacement controller modules

After you have replaced all hardware at the disaster site, you must determine the system ID of the newly installed storage controller module or modules.

.About this task

You must perform this procedure with the replacement controller modules in Maintenance mode.

This section provides examples for two and four-node configurations. For two-node configurations, you can ignore references to the second node at each site. For eight-node configurations, you must account for the additional nodes on the second DR group. The examples make the following assumptions:

* Site A is the disaster site.
* node_A_1 has been replaced.
* node_A_2 has been replaced.
+
Present only in four-node MetroCluster configurations.

* Site B is the surviving site.
* node_B_1 is healthy.
* node_B_2 is healthy.
+
Present only in four-node MetroCluster configurations.

The examples in this procedure use controllers with the following system IDs:

|===

h| Number of nodes in MetroCluster configuration h| Node h| Original system ID h| New system ID h| Will pair with this node as DR partner

a|
node_B_1
a|
4068741254
a|

a|
node_A_1
|===

NOTE: In a four-node MetroCluster configuration, the system determines DR partnerships by pairing the node with the lowest system ID at site_A and the node with the lowest system ID at site_B. Because the system IDs change, the DR pairs might be different after the controller replacements are completed than they were prior to the disaster.

In the preceding example:

* node_A_1 (1574774970) will be paired with node_B_1 (4068741254)
* node_A_2 (1574774991) will be paired with node_B_2 (4068741256)

.Steps

. With the node in Maintenance mode, display the local system ID of the node from each node: `disk show`
+
In the following example, the new local system ID is 1574774970:
+
----
*> disk show
 Local System ID: 1574774970
 ...
----

. On the second node, repeat the previous step.
+
NOTE: This step is not required in a two-node MetroCluster configuration.

+
In the following example, the new local system ID is 1574774991:
+
----
*> disk show
 Local System ID: 1574774991
 ...
----

== Verify the ha-config state of components

In a MetroCluster configuration, the ha-config state of the controller module and chassis components must be set to "mcc" or "mcc-2n" so they boot up properly.

.Before you begin

The system must be in Maintenance mode.

.About this task

This task must be performed on each new controller module.

.Steps
. In Maintenance mode, display the HA state of the controller module and chassis:
+
`ha-config show`
+
The correct HA state depends on your MetroCluster configuration.
+

|===

h| Number of controllers in the MetroCluster configuration h| HA state for all components should be...

a|
Eight- or four-node MetroCluster FC configuration
a|
mcc
a|
Two-node MetroCluster FC configuration
a|
mcc-2n
a|
MetroCluster IP configuration
a|
mccip
|===

. If the displayed system state of the controller is not correct, set the HA state for the controller module:
+

|===

h| Number of controllers in the MetroCluster configuration h| Command

a|
Eight- or four-node MetroCluster FC configuration
a|
`ha-config modify controller mcc`
a|
Two-node MetroCluster FC configuration
a|
`ha-config modify controller mcc-2n`
a|
MetroCluster IP configuration
a|
`ha-config modify controller mccip`
|===

. If the displayed system state of the chassis is not correct, set the HA state for the chassis:
+

|===

h| Number of controllers in the MetroCluster configuration h| Command

a|
Eight- or four-node MetroCluster FC configuration
a|
`ha-config modify chassis mcc`
a|
Two-node MetroCluster FC configuration
a|
`ha-config modify chassis mcc-2n`
a|
MetroCluster IP configuration
a|
`ha-config modify chassis mccip`
|===

. Repeat these steps on the other replacement node.

== Determine if end-to-end encryption was enabled on the original systems

You should verify if the original systems were configured for end-to-end encryption.

.Step

. Run the following command from the surviving site:
+
`metrocluster node show -fields is-encryption-enabled`
+
If encryption is enabled, the following output is displayed: 
+
----
1 cluster_A node_A_1 true
1 cluster_A node_A_2 true
1 cluster_B node_B_1 true
1 cluster_B node_B_2 true
4 entries were displayed.
----
