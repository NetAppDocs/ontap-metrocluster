You should know how the various switch ports should be configured.

NOTE: The following examples use decimal values and follow the table that applies to Cisco switches. Depending on the switch vendor, you might require different values for DSCP. Refer to the corresponding table for your switch vendor to confirm the correct value.

.Switchport connecting a MetroCluster interface

* Classification for remote direct memory access (RDMA) traffic: 
** Match : TCP port 10006, source, destination, or both
** Optional match: COS 5
** Optional match: DSCP 40
** Set DSCP 40
** Set COS 5
** Optional : rate shaping to 20Gbps
* Classification for iSCSI traffic: 
** Match : TCP port 62500, source, destination, or both
** Optional match: COS 4
** Optional match: DSCP 32
** Set DSCP 32
** Set COS 4
* L2FlowControl (pause), RX and TX

.ISL ports

* Classification:
** Match COS 5 or DSCP 40
*** Set DSCP 40
*** Set COS 5
** Match COS 4 or DSCP 32
*** Set DSCP 32
*** Set COS 4
* Egress queuing
** COS group 4 has a minimum configuration threshold of 2000 and a maximum threshold of 3000 
** COS group 5 has a minimum configuration threshold of 3500 and a maximum threshold of 6500.
+
NOTE: Configuration thresholds can vary depending on the environment. You must evaluate the configuration thresholds based on your individual environment.
+
** ECN enabled for Q4 and Q5
** RED enabled for Q4 and Q5

.Bandwidth allocation (switch ports connecting MetroCluster interfaces and ISL ports)
* RDMA, COS 5 / DSCP 40: 60%
* iSCSI, COS 4 / DSCP 32: 40%
* Minimum capacity requirement per MetroCluster and network: 10Gbps

NOTE: If you use rate limits, then the traffic should be *shaped* without introducing loss.

== Examples for configuring switch ports connecting the MetroCluster controller

The examples provided are valid for Cisco NX3232 or Cisco NX9336 switches. If other switches are used, these commands can be used as guidance, but the commands might be different. If a feature or its equivalent shown in the examples is not available on the switch, this means that the switch does not meet the minimum requirements and cannot be used to deploy a MetroCluster configuration. This is true for any switch that is connecting a MetroCluster configuration and for all switches on the path between those switches.

NOTE: The following examples might show the configuration for one network only.

.Basic configuration
A virtual LAN (VLAN) in each network must be configured. The example shows how to configure a VLAN in network 10.

*Example:*

----
# vlan 10
The load balancing policy should be set so that order is preserved.
----

*Example:*
----
# port-channel load-balance src-dst ip-l4port-vlan
----

== Configuring classification

You must configure the access and class maps which map the RDMA and iSCSI traffic to the appropriate classes.

In the following example, all TCP traffic to and from the port 65200 is mapped to the storage (iSCSI) class. All TCP traffic to and from the port 10006 is mapped to the RDMA class. These policy-maps are used on switch ports connecting the MetroCluster interfaces.

*Example:*
----
ip access-list storage
  10 permit tcp any eq 65200 any
  20 permit tcp any any eq 65200
ip access-list rdma
  10 permit tcp any eq 10006 any
  20 permit tcp any any eq 10006

class-map type qos match-all storage
  match access-group name storage
class-map type qos match-all rdma
match access-group name rdma
----

You must configure the ingress policy. The ingress policy maps the traffic as classified to the different COS groups. In this example, the RDMA traffic is mapped to COS group 5 and iSCSI traffic is mapped to COS group 4. The ingress policy is used on switch ports connecting the MetroCluster interfaces and on the ISL ports carrying MetroCluster traffic.

*Example:*
----
policy-map type qos MetroClusterIP_Ingress
class rdma
  set dscp 40
  set cos 5
  set qos-group 5
class storage
  set dscp 32
  set cos 4
  set qos-group 4
----

NetApp recommends that you shape traffic on switch ports connecting a MetroCluster interface if the switch ports operational speed is greater than 10Gbps.

*Example:*
----
policy-map type queuing MetroClusterIP_Node_Egress
class type queuing c-out-8q-q7
  priority level 1
class type queuing c-out-8q-q6
  priority level 2
class type queuing c-out-8q-q5
  priority level 3
  shape min 0 gbps max 20 gbpsclass type queuing c-out-8q-q4
  priority level 4
class type queuing c-out-8q-q3
  priority level 5
class type queuing c-out-8q-q2
  priority level 6
class type queuing c-out-8q-q1
  priority level 7
class type queuing c-out-8q-q-default
  bandwidth remaining percent 100
  random-detect threshold burst-optimized ecn
----

== Configuring the node ports 

You might need to configure the node port in breakout mode. In this example, ports 25 and 26 are configured in 4 x 25Gbps breakout mode.

*Example:*
----
interface breakout module 1 port 25-26 map 25g-4x
----

You might need to configure the MetroCluster interface port speed. The example shows how to configure the speed to *auto* or into 40Gbps mode

*Example:*
----
	speed auto

	speed 40000
----

The following example shows a switch port configured to connect a MetroCluster interface. It is an access mode port in VLAN 10, with MTU of 9216 and is operating in native speed. It has symmetric (send and receive) flow control (pause) enabled and the MetroCluster ingress and egress policies assigned.

*Example:*
----
interface eth1/9
description MetroCluster-IP Node Port
speed auto
switchport access vlan 10
spanning-tree port type edge
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
mtu 9216
flowcontrol receive on
flowcontrol send on
service-policy type qos input MetroClusterIP_Ingress
service-policy type queuing output MetroClusterIP_Node_Egress
no shutdown
----

On 25Gbps ports, the Forward Error Correction (FEC) setting might need to be set to "off" as shown in the example.

*Example:*
----
fec off
----

==  Configuration of the ISL ports throughout the network

A MetroCluster-compliant switch is regarded as an intermediate switch, even it directly connects the MetroCluster interfaces. The ISL ports carrying MetroCluster traffic on the MetroCluster-compliant switch must be configured the same way as the ISL ports on an intermediate switch. Refer to the section link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/concept_considerations_layer_2.html#required-settings-on-intermediate-switches[Required settings on intermediate switches^] for guidance and examples. Note that some policy-maps are the same for switch ports connecting MetroCluster interfaces and ISLs carrying MetroCluster traffic. You can leverage the same policy-map for both port usages.

== Examples of MetroCluster network topologies

Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, some additional network configurations are supported for MetroCluster IP configurations. This section provides some examples of the supported network configurations. Not all the supported topologies are listed.

In either of these topologies, it is assumed that the ISL and intermediate network is configured according to the requirements mentioned previously. 

NOTE: If sharing an ISL with non-MetroCluster traffic, you must make sure that the MetroCluster has at least the minimum required bandwidth available at all times.

=== Shared network configuration with direct links

In this topology, two distinct sites are connected by direct links. These links can be between xWDM and TDM devices or switches. The capacity of the ISLs is not dedicated to the MetroCluster traffic but is shared with other non-MetroCluster traffic.

=== Shared infrastructure with intermediate networks

In this topology, the MetroCluster sites are not directly connected but MetroCluster and the host traffic travel through a network. 
The network can consist of a series of xWDM and TDM and switches, but unlike the shared configuration with direct ISLs, the links are not direct between the sites. Depending on the infrastructure between the sites, any combination of network configurations is possible.

=== Multiple MetroCluster configurations sharing an intermediate network

In this topology, two separate MetroCluster configurations are sharing the same intermediate network. In the example, MetroCluster one switch_A_1 and MetroCluster two switch_A_1 both connect to the same intermediate switch. 

NOTE: Both “MetroCluster one” or “MetroCluster two” can be one 8-node MetroCluster configuration or two 4-node MetroCluster configurations.

=== Combination of a MetroCluster configuration using NetApp validated switches and a configuration using MetroCluster-compliant switches

Two separate MetroCluster configurations share the same intermediate switch, where one MetroCluster is configured using NetApp validated switches in a shared Layer 2 configuration (MetroCluster one), and the other MetroCluster is configured using MetroCluster-compliant switches connecting directly to the intermediate switches (MetroCluster two).
