You must set up each node in the MetroCluster configuration in ONTAP, including the node-level configurations and the configuration of the nodes into two sites. You must also implement the MetroCluster relationship between the two sites.

If a controller module fails during configuration, refer to link:../disaster-recovery/concept_choosing_the_correct_recovery_procedure_parent_concept.html#controller-module-failure-scenarios-during-metrocluster-installation[Controller module failure scenarios during  installation].
