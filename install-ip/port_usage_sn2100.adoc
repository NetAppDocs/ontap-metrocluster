The port usage in a MetroCluster IP configuration depends on the switch model and platform type.

Review the following considerations before using the configuration tables:

* Connecting an eight-node or two four-node MetroCluster configurations requires ONTAP 9.14.1 or later and RCF file version 2.00 or later. 
+
NOTE: The RCF file version is different to the version of the RCFfilegenerator tool used to generate the file. For example, you can generate an RCF file version 2.00 using RCFfilegenerator v1.6c. 

// 2024 Jul 09, GH issue 400
* If you cable multiple MetroCluster configurations then follow the respective table.
For example:

** If you cable two four-node MetroCluster configurations of type AFF A700, then connect the first MetroCluster shown as "MetroCluster 1", and the second MetroCluster shown as "MetroCluster 2" in the AFF A700 table.

NOTE: Ports 13 and 14 can be used in native speed mode supporting 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps, or in breakout mode to support 4 × 25 Gbps or 4 × 10 Gbps. If they use native speed mode they are represented as ports 13 and 14. If they use breakout mode, either 4 × 25 Gbps or 4 × 10 Gbps, then they are represented as ports 13s0-3 and 14s0-3.

The following sections describe the physical cabling outline.  You can also refer to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/rcffilegenerator[RcfFileGenerator] for detailed cabling information.

== Choose the correct cabling table for your configuration

Use the following table to determine which cabling table you should follow.
