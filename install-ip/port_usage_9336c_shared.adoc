[.lead]
The port usage in a MetroCluster IP configuration depends on the switch model and platform type.

Review the following considerations before using the configuration tables:

* At least one MetroCluster configuration or DR group must support switch-attached NS224 shelves.
* Platforms that do not support switch-attached NS224 shelves can only be connected as a second MetroCluster configuration or as a second DR group.
* The RcfFileGenerator only shows eligible platforms when the first platform is selected.
* Connecting one eight-node or two four-node MetroCluster configurations requires ONTAP 9.14.1 or later.

== Choose the correct cabling table for your configuration 

Review the correct port assignments table for your configuration. There are two sets of cabling tables in this section: 

* <<tables_connecting_ns224, Cabling tables for controllers directly connecting to switch-attached NS224 shelves>>
* <<tables_not_connecting_ns224,Cabling tables for controllers not directly connecting to switch-attached NS224 shelves>>

[[tables_connecting_ns224]]
=== Controllers directly connecting to switch-attached NS224 shelves

Determine which port assignments table you should follow for controllers directly connecting to switch-attached NS224 shelves.
