[.lead]
The port usage in a MetroCluster IP configuration depends on the switch model and platform type.

Review the following considerations before using the configuration tables:

* The tables in this section are for 12-port Cisco 9336C-FX2 switches.
+
If you have a 36-port Cisco 9336C-FX2 switch, use the tables in link:port_usage_3232c_9336c.html[Platform port assignments for Cisco 3232C or 36-port Cisco 9336C-FX2 switches].
+
If you have a 36-port Cisco 9336C-FX2 switch and at least one MetroCluster configuration or DR group is connecting NS224 shelves to the MetroCluster switch, use the tables in  link:port_usage_9336c_shared.html[Platform port assignments for a 36-port Cisco 9336C-FX2 switch connecting NS224 storage].
* The following tables show the port usage for site A. The same cabling is used for site B.
* The switches cannot be configured with ports of different speeds (for example, a mix of 100 Gbps ports and 40 Gbps ports).
* If you are configuring a single MetroCluster with the switches, use the *MetroCluster 1* port group.
+
Keep track of the MetroCluster port group (MetroCluster 1, MetroCluster 2). You'll need it when using the RcfFileGenerator tool as described later in this configuration procedure.

* The RcfFileGenerator for MetroCluster IP also provides a per-port cabling overview for each switch.


== Choose the correct cabling table for your configuration

Use the following table to determine which cabling table you should follow.
