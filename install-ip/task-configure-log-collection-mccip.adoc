= Configure log collection on a MetroCluster IP switch

:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
In a MetroCluster IP configuration, you can configure log collection to collect switch logs for debugging purposes. 

CAUTION: On Broadcom and Cisco switches, a new user is required for each cluster with log collection. For example,  MetroCluster 1, MetroCluster 2, MetroCluster 3, and MetroCluster 4 all require a separate user to be configured on the switches. Multiple SSH keys for the same user is not supported.

CAUTION: If any error statuses are reported by the log collection feature (visible in the output of `system switch ethernet log show`), see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-switches/switch-cshm/log-collection-troubleshoot.html[Troubleshoot log collection^] for further details.
