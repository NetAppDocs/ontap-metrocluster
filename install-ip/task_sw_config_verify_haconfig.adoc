summary: In a MetroCluster IP configuration that is not preconfigured at the factory, you must verify that the ha-config state of the controller and chassis components is set to mccip so that they boot up properly. For systems received from the factory, this value is preconfigured and you do not need to verify it.

In a MetroCluster IP configuration, you must verify that the ha-config state of the controller and chassis components is set to "`mccip`" so that they boot up properly. Although this value should be preconfigured on systems received from the factory, you should still verify the setting before proceeding.
