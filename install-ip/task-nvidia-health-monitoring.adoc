[.lead]
Follow this procedure to install the applicable configuration file for Ethernet switch health monitoring of NVIDIA cluster switches. 

Supported models are:

* MSN2100-CB2FC
* MSN2100-CB2RC
* X190006-PE
* X190006-PI

NOTE: This installation procedure applies to ONTAP 9.10.1 and later.

//In future patch releases the configuration file will be bundled with ONTAP. 

.Before you begin

* Verify that you need to download the configuration file by running `system switch ethernet show` and checking if *OTHER* is shown for your model. 
+
If your model is still showing *OTHER*  after applying the configuration file, contact NetApp support. 
//* Make sure that the Ethernet switch health monitor process is running using `spm show -name cshmd`
* Make sure that the ONTAP cluster is up and running.
* Enable SSH to use all of the features available in CSHM.
* Clear the `/mroot/etc/cshm_nod/nod_sign/` directory on all nodes: 
.. Enter the nodeshell:
+
`system node run -node <name>`
.. Change to advanced privilege:
+
`priv set advanced`
.. List the configuration files in the `/etc/cshm_nod/nod_sign` directory. If the directory exists and contains configuration files, it lists the file names.
+
`ls /etc/cshm_nod/nod_sign`
.. Delete all configuration files corresponding to your connected switch models. 
+
If you are unsure, remove all configuration files for the supported models listed above, then download and install the latest configuration files for those same models.
+
`rm /etc/cshm_nod/nod_sign/<filename>`
.. Confirm that the deleted configuration files are no longer in the directory:
+
`ls /etc/cshm_nod/nod_sign`

.Steps

. Download the Ethernet switch health monitor configuration zip file based on the corresponding ONTAP release version. This file is available from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/nvidia-cluster-switch[NVIDIA Ethernet switches^] page.
 .. On the NVIDIA SN2100 Software download page, select *Nvidia CSHM File*.
 .. On the Caution/Must read page, select the check box to agree.
 .. On the End User License Agreement page, select the check box to agree and click *Accept & Continue*.
 .. On the Nvidia CSHM File - Download page, select the applicable configuration file. The following files are available:

. [[step6]]Wait up to twice the Ethernet switch health monitor polling interval, found by running `system switch ethernet polling-interval show`, before completing the next step.

. Run the command `system switch ethernet show` on the ONTAP system and make sure that the cluster switches are discovered with the monitored field set to *True* and the serial number field not showing *Unknown*.

//NOTE: If at any time you revert to an earlier version of ONTAP, you will need to install the CSHM configuration file again to enable switch health monitoring of NVIDIA cluster switches.
