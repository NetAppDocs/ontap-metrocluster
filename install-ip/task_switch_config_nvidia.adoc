[.lead]
You must configure the NVIDIA SN2100 IP switches for use as the cluster interconnect and for backend MetroCluster IP connectivity.


== [[Reset-the-switch]] Reset the NVIDIA IP SN2100 switch to factory defaults

You can choose from the following methods to reset a switch to factory default settings.

* <<RCF-file-option, Reset the switch using the RCF file option>>
* <<Cumulus-install-option, Download and install the Cumulus software>>


=== [[RCF-file-option]]Reset the switch using the RCF file option

Before installing a new RCF configuration you must revert the NVIDIA switch settings.

.About this task


To restore the switch to default settings, run the RCF file with the `restoreDefaults` option. This option copies the original backed up files to their original location and then reboots the switch. After reboot, the switch comes online with the original configuration that existed when you first ran the RCF file to configure the switch.

The following configuration details are not reset:

* User and credential configuration
* Configuration of the management network port, eth0

NOTE: All other configuration changes that occur during application of the RCF file are reverted to the original configuration.

.Before you begin
* You must configure the switch according to <<Download-and-install, Download and install the NVIDIA RCF file>>. If you have not configured in this manner, or you have configured additional features before running the RCF file, you cannot use this procedure.
* You must repeat these steps on each of the IP switches in the MetroCluster IP configuration.
* You must be connected to the switch with a serial console connection.
* This task resets the configuration of the management network.




.Steps

. Verify that the RCF configuration was successfully applied with the same or a compatible RCF file version and that the backup files exist.
+
NOTE: The output can show backup files, preserved files, or both. If backup files or preserved files do not appear in the output, you cannot use this procedure.

The switch is reset and retains the initial configuration such as management network configuration and current credentials as they existed before applying the RCF file. After reboot, you can apply a new configuration by using the same or a different version of the RCF file.

=== [[Cumulus-install-option]] Download and install the Cumulus software


.About this task
Use these steps if you want to reset the switch completely by applying the Cumulus image.


.Before you begin

* You must be connected to the switch with a serial console connection.
* The Cumulus switch software image is accessible through HTTP.
+
NOTE: For more information about installing Cumulus Linux, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-switches/switch-nvidia-sn2100/configure-overview-sn2100-cluster.html#initial-configuration-overview[Overview of installation and configuration for NVIDIA SN2100 switches^]

* You must have the root password for `sudo` access to the commands.


.Steps


. From the Cumulus console download and queue the switch software installation with the command `onie-install -a -i` followed by the file path to the switch software:
+
In this example, the firmware file `cumulus-linux-4.4.3-mlx-amd64.bin` is copied from the HTTP server '50.50.50.50' to the local switch.

----
cumulus@cumulus:~$ sudo reboot
----
+
When the switch reboots, you can apply a new configuration using the steps in <<Download-and-install, Download and install the NVIDIA RCF file>>.



== [[Download-and-install]]Download and install the NVIDIA RCF files

You must generate and install the switch RCF file to each switch in the MetroCluster IP configuration.


.Before you begin

* You must have the root password for `sudo` access to the commands.
* The switch software is installed and the management network is configured.
* You followed the steps to initially install the switch by using either method 1 or method 2.
* You did not apply any additional configuration after the initial installation.
+
NOTE: If you perform further configuration after resetting the switch and before applying the RCF file, you cannot use this procedure.


.About this task
You must repeat these steps on each of the IP switches in the MetroCluster IP configuration (new installation) or on the replacement switch (switch replacement).


.Steps
. Generate the NVIDIA RCF files for MetroCluster IP.

.. Download the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/rcffilegenerator[RcfFileGenerator for MetroCluster IP^].
.. Generate the RCF file for your configuration by using the RcfFileGenerator for MetroCluster IP.



.. Navigate to your home directory. If you are logged as 'cumulus', the file path is `/home/cumulus`.

cumulus@IP_switch_A_1:mgmt:~$ cd ~
cumulus@IP_switch_A_1:mgmt:~$ pwd
/home/cumulus
cumulus@IP_switch_A_1:mgmt:~$
----

.. Download the RCF file to this directory.
The following example shows that you use SCP to download the file `SN2100_v2.0.0_IP_switch_A_1.txt` from server '50.50.50.50' to your home directory and save it as `SN2100_v2.0.0_IP_switch_A_1.py`:

Running Step 24: Final reboot of the switch



... The switch will reboot if all steps applied successfully ...
----

. If your configuration uses DAC cables, enable the DAC option on the switch ports: 
+
----
cumulus@IP_switch_A_1:mgmt:~$ sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0.0-X10_Switch-A1.py runCmd <switchport> DacOption [enable | disable]
----
+
The following example enables the DAC option for port `swp7`:
+
----
cumulus@IP_switch_A_1:mgmt:~$ sudo python3 SN2100_v2.00_Switch-A1.py runCmd swp7 DacOption enable
    Running cumulus version  : 5.4.0
    Running RCF file version : v2.00
    Running command: Enabling the DacOption for port swp7
    runCmd: 'nv set interface swp7 link fast-linkup on', ret: 0
    runCmd: committed, ret: 0
    Completion: SUCCESS
cumulus@IP_switch_A_1:mgmt:~$
----

. Reboot the switch after enabling the DAC option on the switch ports:
+
`sudo reboot`
+
NOTE: When you set the DAC option for multiple switch ports, you only need to reboot the switch once.

== Set Forward Error Correction for systems using 25-Gbps connectivity

If your system is configured using 25-Gbps connectivity, set the Forward Error Correction (fec) parameter manually to off after applying the RCF. The RCF does not apply this setting.

.About this task

* This task only applies to platforms using 25-Gbps connectivity. Refer to link:../install-ip/port_usage_sn2100.html[Platform port assignments for NVIDIA supported SN2100 IP switches].

* This task must be performed on all four switches in the MetroCluster IP configuration.

* You must update each switch port individually, you cannot specify multiple ports or port ranges in the command.

.Steps

. Set the `fec` parameter to off for the first switch port that uses 25-Gbps connectivity: 
+
`sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_Switch-A1.py runCmd <switchport> fec off`

. Repeat the step for each 25-Gbps switch port that is connected to a controller module. 

== Set the switch port speed for the MetroCluster IP interfaces

.About this task

* Use this procedure to set the switch port speed to 100G for the following systems:

** AFF A70, AFF A90, AFF A1K, AFF C80
** FAS90, FAS70
** AFF A30, AFF C30, AFF A50, AFF C60 

* You must update each switch port individually, you cannot specify multiple ports or port ranges in the command.

.Step

. Use the RCF file with the `runCmd` option to set the speed. This applies the setting and saves the configuration.
+
The following commands set the speed for the MetroCluster interfaces `swp7` and `swp8`:
+
[source,cli]
sudo python3 SN2100_v2.20 _Switch-A1.py runCmd swp7 speed 100
+
[source,cli]
sudo python3 SN2100_v2.20 _Switch-A1.py runCmd swp8 speed 100

== Disable unused ISL ports and port channels

NetApp recommends disabling unused ISL ports and port channels to avoid unnecessary health alerts. You must disable each port or port channel individually, you cannot specify multiple ports or port ranges in the command. 

.Steps 

. Identify the unused ISL ports and port channels using the RCF file banner:
+
NOTE: If the port is in breakout mode, the port name you specify in the command might be different than the name stated in the RCF banner. You can also use the RCF cabling files to find the port name. 
+ 
`net show interface`


. Disable the unused ISL ports and port channels using the RCF file.

cumulus@mcc1-integrity-a1:mgmt:~$ sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_IP_Switch-A1.py runCmd
[sudo] password for cumulus:
    Running cumulus version  : 5.4.0
    Running RCF file version : v2.0
Help for runCmd:
    To run a command execute the RCF script as follows:
    sudo python3 <script> runCmd <option-1> <option-2> <option-x>
    Depending on the command more or less options are required. Example to 'up' port 'swp1'
        sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_IP_Switch-A1.py runCmd swp1 up
    Available commands:
        UP / DOWN the switchport
            sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_IP_Switch-A1.py runCmd <switchport> state <up | down>
        Set the switch port speed
            sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_Switch-A1.py runCmd <switchport> speed <10 | 25 | 40 | 100 | AN>
        Set the fec mode on the switch port
            sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_Switch-A1.py runCmd <switchport> fec <default | auto | rs | baser | off>
        Set the [localISL | remoteISL] to 'UP' or 'DOWN' state
            sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_Switch-A1.py runCmd [localISL | remoteISL] state [up | down]
        Set the option on the port to support DAC cables. This option does not support port ranges.
            You must reload the switch after changing this option for the required ports. This will disrupt traffic.
            This setting requires Cumulus 5.4 or a later 5.x release.
            sudo python3 SN2100_v2.0_Switch-A1.py runCmd <switchport> DacOption [enable | disable]
