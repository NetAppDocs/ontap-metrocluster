= Platform port assignments for Broadcom supported BES-53248 IP switches

[.lead]
The port usage in a MetroCluster IP configuration depends on the switch model and platform type.

The switches cannot be configured with ports of different speeds (for example, a mix of 25 Gbps ports and 10 Gbps ports).

Notes for the tables below:

. For some platforms, you can use ports 49 - 54 for MetroCluster ISLs or MetroCluster interface connections.
+
These ports require an additional license.

. Only a single AFF A320 system can be connected to the switch and no other platform can be connected at the same time.
+
Features that require a switched cluster are not supported in this configuration, including MetroCluster FC to IP transition and tech refresh procedures.

. AFF A320 systems configured with Broadcom BES-53248 switches might not support all features.
+
Any configuration or feature that requires that the local cluster connections are connected to a switch is not supported. For example, the following configurations and procedures are not supported:

 ** Eight-node MetroCluster configurations
 ** Transitioning from MetroCluster FC to MetroCluster IP configurations
 ** Refreshing a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration (ONTAP 9.8 and later)
