[.lead]
The port usage in a MetroCluster IP configuration depends on the switch model and platform type.

The switches cannot be used with remote ISL ports of different speeds (for example, a 25 Gbps port connected to a 10 Gbps ISL port).
//1386105 2021.11.23

.Notes for the tables below:

. For some platforms, you can use ports 49 - 54 for MetroCluster ISLs or MetroCluster interface connections.
+
These ports require an additional license.

. Only a single four-node MetroCluster using A320 systems can be connected to the switch.
+
Features that require a switched cluster are not supported in this configuration, including MetroCluster FC to IP transition and tech refresh procedures.

. AFF A320 systems configured with Broadcom BES-53248 switches might not support all features.
+
Any configuration or feature that requires that the local cluster connections are connected to a switch is not supported. For example, the following configurations and procedures are not supported:

 ** Eight-node MetroCluster configurations
 ** Transitioning from MetroCluster FC to MetroCluster IP configurations
 ** Refreshing a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration (ONTAP 9.8 and later)

 . If you connect two MetroCluster configurations and both use the same controller type, then you must use MetroCluster port groups 3 and 4. If the controllers are different, then you must use either MetroCluster port groups 3 and 4 for one type and MetroCluster port groups 1 and 2 for the other.

 ** For example, if you connect:

* Two MetroCluster configurations consisting of FAS2750/AFF A220 only, or FAS500f/AFF A250 only, you must select MetroCluster port groups 3 and 4.
* Two MetroCluster configurations where one MetroCluster is type FAS2750/AFF A220 and the other is FAS500f/AFF A250, you must select port groups 3 and 4 for one, and port groups 1 and 2 for the other.
In the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/rcffilegenerator[RcfFileGenerator for MetroCluster IP], drop-down fields 1 and 2 only populate with the supported platform after you select platforms in drop-down fields 3 and 4.
Refer to link:../install-ip/using_rcf_generator.html[Using the port tables with the RcfFileGenerator tool or multiple MetroCluster configurations] for more information on how to use the port tables.
