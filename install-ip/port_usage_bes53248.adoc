[.lead]
The port usage in a MetroCluster IP configuration depends on the switch model and platform type.

Review the following considerations before using the configuration tables: 

* You cannot use the switches with remote ISL ports of different speeds (for example, a 25 Gbps port connected to a 10 Gbps ISL port).
//1386105 2021.11.23

* If you configure the switch for MetroCluster FC to IP Transition, the following ports are used depending on the target platform that you choose:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="75,25"]
|===
| Target platform
| Port
| FAS500f, AFF C250, ASA C250, AFF A250, ASA A250, FAS8300, AFF C400, ASA C400, AFF A400, ASA A400, or FAS8700 platforms | ports 1 - 6, 10Gbps
| FAS8200 or AFF A300 platforms| ports 3 - 4 and 9 - 12, 10Gbps
|===

* AFF A320 systems configured with Broadcom BES-53248 switches might not support all features.
+
Any configuration or feature that requires that the local cluster connections are connected to a switch is not supported. For example, the following configurations and procedures are not supported:

 ** Eight-node MetroCluster configurations
 ** Transitioning from MetroCluster FC to MetroCluster IP configurations
 ** Refreshing a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration (ONTAP 9.8 and later)


== Choose the correct cabling table for your configuration

Use the following table to determine which cabling table you should follow.

* *Note 1*: Using these ports requires an additional license.

* If both MetroCluster configurations are using the same the platform, NetApp recommends selecting group "MetroCluster 3" for one configuration and group "MetroCluster 4" for the other configuration. If the platforms are different, then you must select "MetroCluster 3" or "MetroCluster 4" for the first configuration, and "MetroCluster 1" or "MetroCluster 2" for the second configuration.

[NOTE] 
====
* This configuration requires a four-port 25G Ethernet card in slot 4 to connect the local cluster and HA interfaces. 
* This configuration requires a QSFP-to-SFP+ adapter in the card on the controller to support a 25Gbps network speed.
