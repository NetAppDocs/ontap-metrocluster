Starting with ONTAP 9.7, the ONTAP Mediator service can assist the MetroCluster IP configuration in performing an automatic unplanned switchover by providing a physically separate repository for status information.

[NOTE]
====
- The ONTAP Mediator service and MetroCluster Tiebreaker software should not both be used with the same MetroCluster configuration.
- The ONTAP Mediator must be installed on a LINUX host at a separate location from the MetroCluster sites.
- The ONTAP Mediator service can support up to five MetroCluster configurations simultaneously.
