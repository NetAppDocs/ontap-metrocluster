Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can manage an IP configuration of a MetroCluster operation with System Manager. After setting up two clusters, you set up peering between them.

.Before you start
You should have completed the following procedure to set up two clusters:

* link:install-ip/set-up-mcc-site-system-manager.html[Set up a MetroCluster IP site]

Certain steps of this process are performed by different system administrators located at the geographical sites of each cluster.  For the purposes of explaining this process, the clusters are called "Site A cluster" and "Site B cluster".

== Performing the peering process from Site A

This process is performed by a system administrator at Site A.

.Steps

. Log in to Site A cluster.

. In System Manager, select *Dashboard* from the left navigation column to display the cluster overview.
+
The dashboard shows the details for this cluster (Site A).  In the *MetroCluster* section, Site A cluster is shown on the left.

. Click *Attach Partner Cluster*.

. Enter the details of the network interfaces that allow the nodes in Site A cluster to communicate with the nodes in Site B cluster.

. Click *Save and Continue*.

. On the *Attach Partner Cluster* window, select *I do not have a passphrase*, which lets you generate a passphrase.

. Copy the generated passphrase and share it with the system administrator at Site B.

. Select *Close*.

== Performing the peering process from Site B

This process is performed by a system administrator at Site B.

.Steps

. Log in to Site B cluster.

. In System Manager, select *Dashboard* to display the cluster overview.
+
The dashboard shows the details for this cluster (Site B).  In the MetroCluster section, Site B cluster is shown on the left.

. Click *Attach Partner Cluster* to start the peering process.

. Enter the details of the network interfaces that allow the nodes in Site B cluster to communicate with the nodes in Site A cluster.

. Click *Save and Continue*.

. On the *Attach Partner Cluster* window, select *I have a passphrase*, which lets you enter the passphrase that you received from the system administrator at Site A.

. Select *Peer* to complete the peering process.

.What's next?

After the peering process is successfully completed, you configure the clusters.  See link:configure-mcc-site-system-manager.html[Configure a MetroCluster IP site].
