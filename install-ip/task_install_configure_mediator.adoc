To install the ONTAP Mediator service, you must ensure all prerequisites are met, get the installation package and run the installer on the host.

.Before you begin

//ontap-metrocluster/issues/35
You must meet the following prerequisites.

NOTE: The kernel version must match the operating system version.

// BURT 1392725
* 64-bit physical installation or virtual machine
* 8 GB RAM
* User: Root access

The best practices for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS and the associated repositories on your system are listed below. Systems installed or configured differently might require additional steps.

* You must install Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS according to Red Hat best practices.
* While installing the ONTAP Mediator service on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, the system must have access to the appropriate repository so that the installation program can access and install all the required software dependencies.
* For the yum installer to find dependent software in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repositories, you must have registered the system during the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation or afterwards by using a valid Red Hat subscription.
+
See the Red Hat documentation for information about the Red Hat Subscription Manager.
* The following ports must be unused and available for the Mediator:
 ** 31784
 ** 3260
* If using a third-party firewall: refer to link:concept_mediator_requirements.html#firewall-requirements-for-ontap-mediator[Firewall requirements for ONTAP Mediator]
* If the Linux host is in a location without access to the internet, you can either install the packages manually or you must ensure that the required packages are available in a local repository.
+
You can use the following link for information about setting up a repository.
+
If you are using Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) in a Linux environment, you must correctly configure the kernel and make sure the `sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` is set to "2".

The following packages are required by the ONTAP Mediator service:

* If signature verification is configured, it must be disabled. This can be done in one of two ways:
 ** If the UEFI SecureBoot mechanism is configured, disable it.
 ** Disable the signature verification mechanism by updating and regenerating the grub.cfg file:
  ... Open the /etc/default/grub file.
  ... Add the string module.sig_enforce=0 to the end of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX statement.
  ... Regenerate the grub.cfg file to implement the change:
+
`update-bootloader || update-grub || grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
  ... Reboot the host.

The Mediator installation package is a self-extracting compressed tar file that includes:

* An RPM file containing all dependencies that cannot be obtained from the supported release's repository.
* An install script.

A valid SSL certification is recommended, as documented in this procedure.

This procedure is used for an installation or an upgrade of an existing installation.

[[centos8x]]
=== Procedure for CentOS 8.0.1905 or later operating system

CAUTION: Life support for CentOS 8.x will end on December 31, 2021. . If using CentOS with ONTAP, it is recommneded that you revert to <<centos7x, CentOS 7.x>> operating system.

If your operating system is *CentOS 8.0.1905 or later builds*:

.Before you begin

In the http://vault.centos.org[CentOS Vault], locate the kernel-devel package that matches your operating system. Because the latest versions of the 8.0 (CentOS 8.0.1905 and later) core reside in the https://vault.centos.org[CentOS Vault], you must provide access to the matching kernel-devel package to compile the needed kernel module.

// 03 SEP 2021, BURT 1399705

.Steps

. [[step1-rpm]] Issue the following command to directly install the kernel-devel package:
+
`rpm -i \http://vault.centos.org/8.0.1905/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/kernel-devel-$(uname -r).rpm`
+
--
NOTE: The above command is an example that is specific to CentOS 8.0.1905.  Change the path where appropriate for other CentoOS 8.x builds.
--

. If the system displays an error indicating that the package is already installed, remove the package and try again:

.. Remove the kernel-devel package:
+
`yum remove kernel-devel`

.. Repeat the `rpm` command shown in <<step1-rpm, Step 1>>.


== Download the Mediator installation package

.Steps

. Download the Mediator installation package from the ONTAP Mediator page.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/ontap-mediator/downloads-tab[ONTAP Mediator download page]

. Confirm that the Mediator installation package is in the target directory:
+
`ls`
+
----
[root@mediator-host ~]#ls
./ontap-mediator_1.3
----
+
If you are at a location without access to the internet, you must ensure that the installer has access to the required packages.

. If necessary, move the Mediator installation package from the download directory to the installation directory on the Linux Mediator host.

== Install the ONTAP Mediator installation package

.Step

. Install the Mediator installation package and respond to the prompts as required:
+
`./ontap-mediator_1.3`
+
The installation process proceeds to create the required accounts and install required packages. If you have a previous version of Mediator installed on the host, you will be prompted to confirm that you want to upgrade.

link:../media/console_output_mediator_installation.txt[Example of ONTAP Mediator installation (console output)]

== Verify the installation

.Steps

. Run the following command to view the status of the ONTAP Mediator services:
+
`systemctl`
+
