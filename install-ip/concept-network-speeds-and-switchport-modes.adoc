[.lead]
If you are using MetroCluster compliant switches, you should be aware of the platform-specific network speeds and switch port mode requirements.

The following table provides platform-specific network speeds and switch port modes for MetroCluster-compliant switches. You should configure the switch port mode according to the table.

[NOTE]
====
* Missing values indicate that the platform cannot be used with a MetroCluster-compliant switch.
* AFF A30, AFF C30, and FAS50 systems require a QSFP-to-SFP+ adapter in the card on the controller to support a 25Gbps network speed.
