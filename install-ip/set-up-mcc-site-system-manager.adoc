Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use System Manager to set up a MetroCluster IP site.
// 20 OCT 2020...review comment...IP configuration only, not FCP

A MetroCluster site consists of two clusters. Typically, the clusters are located in different geographical locations.

.Before you begin

* Your system should already be installed and cabled according to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems/index.html[Installation and Setup Instructions^] that came with the system.

* Cluster network interfaces should be configured on each node of each cluster for intra-cluster communication.

== Assign a node-management IP address

=== Windows System
You should connect your Windows computer to the same subnet as the controllers. This automatically assigns a node-management IP address to your system.

.Steps
. From the Windows system, open the *Network* drive to discover the nodes.
. Double-click the node to launch the cluster setup wizard.

=== Other systems
You should configure the node-management IP address for one of the nodes in your cluster. You can use this node-management IP address to launch the cluster set up wizard.

See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/software_setup/task_create_the_cluster_on_the_first_node.html[Creating the cluster on the first node^] for information about assigning a node-management IP address.

== Initialize and configure the cluster
You initialize the cluster by setting an administrative password for the cluster and setting up the cluster management and node management networks. You can also configure services like a domain name server (DNS) to resolve host names and an NTP server to synchronize time.

.Steps
. On a web browser, enter the node-management IP address that you have configured: "https://node-management-IP"
+
System Manager automatically discovers the remaining nodes in the cluster.

. In the *Initialize Storage System* window, perform the following:

.. Enter cluster management network configuration data.
.. Enter Node management IP addresses for all the nodes.
.. Provide DNS details.
.. In the *Other* section, select the check box labeled *Use time service (NTP)* to add the time servers.

When you click *Submit*, wait for the cluster to be created and configured. Then, a validation process occurs.

.What's Next?
After both clusters have been set up, initialized, and configured, perform the link:../install-ip/set-up-mcc-peering-system-manager.html[Set up MetroCluster IP peering] procedure.
