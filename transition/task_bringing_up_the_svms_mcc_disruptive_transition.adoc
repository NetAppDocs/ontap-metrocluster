Due to the changes if LIF configuration, you must restart the SVMs on the new nodes.

. Check the state of the SVMs: `metrocluster vserver show`
. Restart the SVMs on cluster_A that do not have an -mc suffix: `vserver start -vserver svm-name -force true`
. Repeat the previous steps on the partner cluster.
. Check that all SVMs are in a healthy state: `metrocluster vserver show`
. Verify that all data LIFs are online: `network interface show`
