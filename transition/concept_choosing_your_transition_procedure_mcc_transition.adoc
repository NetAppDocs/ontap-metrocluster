[.lead]
You must select a transition procedure depending on your existing MetroCluster FC configuration.

A transition procedure replaces the back-end FC switch fabric or FC-VI connection with an IP switch network. The exact procedure depends on your starting configuration.

The original platforms and FC switches (if present) are retired at the end of the transition procedure.
