[.lead]
You can perform nondisruptive transitions of workloads and data from an existing MetroCluster FC configuration to a new MetroCluster IP configuration.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, this procedure is supported in MetroCluster IP configurations in which the MetroCluster and the drive shelves are connected to the same IP switches (a shared storage switch configuration). 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can perform a nondisruptive transition of workloads and data from an existing eight-node MetroCluster FC configuration to a new MetroCluster IP configuration.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can perform a nondisruptive transition of workloads and data from an existing four-node MetroCluster FC configuration to a new MetroCluster IP configuration.

* This procedure is nondisruptive.
+
The MetroCluster configuration can continue to serve data during the operation.

* This procedure applies only to four-node and eight-node MetroCluster FC configurations.
+
If you have a two-node MetroCluster FC configuration, see link:concept_choosing_your_transition_procedure_mcc_transition.html[Choosing your transition procedure].

* This procedure describes the steps required to transition one four-node FC DR group. If you have an eight-node configuration (two FC DR groups), you must repeat the entire procedure for each FC DR group.

* You must meet all requirements and follow all steps in the procedure.

.Important information if you are adding an older platform model

The following guidance is for an uncommon scenario where you need to add an older platform model (platforms released before ONTAP 9.15.1) to an existing MetroCluster configuration that contains a newer platform model (platforms released in ONTAP 9.15.1 or later). For an eight-node FC to IP transition, this guidance applies if you have transitioned your first FC DR group to a platform model introduced in ONTAP 9.15.1 or later and plan to transition the second DR group to a platform introduced before ONTAP 9.15.1.

If your existing MetroCluster configuration contains a platform that uses *shared cluster/HA ports* (platforms released in ONTAP 9.15.1 or later), you cannot add a platform that uses *shared MetroCluster/HA ports* (platforms released before ONTAP 9.15.1) without upgrading all nodes in the configuration to ONTAP 9.15.1P11 or ONTAP 9.16.1P4 or later. 

[CAUTION] 
====
Adding an older platform model that uses *shared/MetroCluster HA ports* to a MetroCluster containing a newer platform model that uses *shared cluster/HA ports* is an uncommon scenario and most combinations are not affected. 
==== 

Use the following table to verify whether your combination is affected. If your existing platform is listed in the first column, and the platform you want to add to the configuration is listed in the second column, all nodes in the configuration must be running ONTAP 9.15.1P11 or ONTAP 9.16.1P4 or later to add the new DR group.

Before you add the new platform to your existing MetroCluster configuration, upgrade all nodes in the existing and new configuration to ONTAP 9.15.1P11 or ONTAP 9.16.1P4 or later.
