You must verify that the MetroCluster is operating correctly and assign drives to the second pair of new nodes (node_A_2-IP and node_B_2-IP).

. Confirm that the MetroCluster configuration-type is IP-fabric: `metrocluster show`
. Perform a MetroCluster check.
 .. Issue the following command: `metrocluster check run`
 .. Display the results of the MetroCluster check: `metrocluster check show`
. Confirm that the DR group with the MetroCluster IP nodes is configured: `metrocluster node show`
. Create and mirror additional data aggregates for controllers node_A_2-IP and node_B_2-IP at each site as needed.
