[.lead]
You must add the four new controller modules and any additional storage shelves to the configuration. The new controller modules are added two-at-a-time.

== Setting up the new controllers

[.lead]
You must rack and cable the new MetroCluster IP controllers to the storage shelves previously connected to the MetroCluster FC controllers.

These steps must be performed on each of the MetroCluster IP nodes.

* node_A_1-IP
* node_A_2-IP
* node_B_1-IP
* node_B_2-IP

In the following example, two additional storage shelves are added at each site to provide storage to accommodate the new controller modules.

image::../media/transition_2n_4_new_ip_nodes_and_shelves.png[]

. Plan out the positioning of the new controller modules and storage shelves as needed.
+
The rack space depends on the platform model of the controller modules, the switch types, and the number of storage shelves in your configuration.

. Properly ground yourself.
. Rack the new equipment: controllers, storage shelves, and IP switches.
+
Do not cable the storage shelves or IP switches at this time.

. Connect the power cables and management console connection to the controllers.
. Verify that all storage shelves are powered off.
. Verify that no drives are connected by performing the following steps on all four nodes:
 .. At the LOADER prompt, launch the boot menu: `boot_ontap maint`
 .. Verify that no drives are connected: `disk show -v`
+
The output should show no drives.

 .. Halt the node: `halt`
. Boot all four nodes using the 9a option on the boot menu.
 .. At the LOADER prompt, launch the boot menu: `boot_ontap menu`
 .. At the boot menu, select option *9a* to reboot the controller.
 .. Let the controller module complete booting before moving to the next controller module.

+
After 9a completes, the nodes automatically return to the boot menu.
. Cable the storage shelves.
+
Refer to the controller installation and setup procedures for your model for cabling information.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/platstor/index.jsp[AFF and FAS Documentation Center]

. Cable the controllers to the IP switches as described in the _MetroCluster IP Installation and Configuration Guide_.
+
link:../install-ip/index.html[MetroCluster IP installation and configuration]

 ** link:../install-ip/task_install_and_cable_the_mcc_components.html#cabling-the-ip-switches[Cabling the IP switches]

. Prepare the IP switches for the application of the new RCF files.
+
Follow the steps in the section for your switch vendor from the _MetroCluster IP Installation and Configuration Guide_.

. Turn on power to the first new controller (node_A_1-IP) and press Ctrl-C to interrupt the boot process and display the LOADER prompt.
. Boot the controller to Maintenance mode: `boot_ontap_maint`
. Display the system ID for the controller: `sysconfig -v`
. Confirm that the shelves from the existing configuration are visible from the new MetroCluster IP node: `storage show shelf``disk show -v`
. Halt the node: `halt`
. Repeat the preceding steps on the other node at the partner site (site_B).

== Connecting and booting up node_A_1-IP and node_B_1-IP

[.lead]
After connecting the MetroCluster IP controllers and IP switches, you transition and boot up node_A_1-IP and node_B_1-IP.

=== Bringing up node_A_1-IP

[.lead]
You must boot the node with the correct transition option.

. Boot node_A_1-IP to the boot menu: `boot_ontap menu`
. Issue the following command at the boot menu prompt to initiate transition: `boot_after_mcc_transition`
 ** This command reassigns all the disks owned by node_A_1-FC to node_A_1-IP.
  *** node_A_1-FC disks are assigned to node_A_1-IP
  *** node_B_1-FC disks are assigned to node_B_1-IP
 ** The command also automatically makes other required system ID reassignments so the MetroCluster IP nodes can boot to the ONTAP prompt.
 ** If the boot_after_mcc_transition command fails for any reason, it should be re-run from the boot menu.
*Note:*
 ** If the following prompt is displayed, enter Ctrl-C to continue. Checking MCC DR state... [enter Ctrl-C(resume), S(status), L(link)]_
 ** If the root volume was encrypted, the node halts with the following message. Halting the system, because root volume is encrypted (NetApp Volume Encryption) and the key import failed. If this cluster is configured with external (KMIP) key-manager, check the health of the key servers.

 .. Again select option (11) Configure node for external key management from the boot menu and respond to the prompts as required.
+
The system boots to the boot menu.

 .. Restore the external key management: `security key-manager external restore`

=== Creating the network configuration

[.lead]
You must create a network configuration that matches the configuration on the FC nodes. This is because the MetroCluster IP node replays the same configuration when it boots, which means that when node_A_1-IP and node_B_1-IP boot, ONTAP will try to host LIFs on the same ports that were used on node_A_1-FC and node_B_1-FC respectively.

As you create the network configuration, use the plan made in xref:concept_requirements_for_fc_to_ip_transition_2n_mcc_transition.adoc[Mapping ports from the MetroCluster FC nodes to the MetroCluster IP nodes] to assist you.

NOTE:

Additional configuration may be needed to bring up data LIFs after the MetroCluster IP nodes have been configured.

. Verify that all cluster ports are in the appropriate broadcast domain:
+
The cluster IPspace and cluster broadcast domain are required in order to create cluster LIFs

 .. View the IP spaces: `network ipspace show`
 .. Create IP spaces and assign cluster ports as needed.
+
http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-nmg/GUID-69120CF0-F188-434F-913E-33ACB8751A5D.html[Configuring IPspaces (cluster administrators only)]

 .. View the broadcast domains: `network port broadcast-domain show`
 .. Add any cluster ports to a broadcast domain as needed.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-nmg/GUID-003BDFCD-58A3-46C9-BF0C-BA1D1D1475F9.html[Adding or removing ports from a broadcast domain]

 .. Recreate VLANs and interface groups as needed.
+
VLAN and interface group membership might be different than that of the old node.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-nmg/GUID-8929FCE2-5888-4051-B8C0-E27CAF3F2A63.html[Creating a VLAN]

. Verify that MTU settings are set correctly for the ports and broadcast domain and make changes using the following commands: `network port broadcast-domain show``network port broadcast-domain modify -broadcast- domain bcastdomainname -mtu mtu`

=== Setting up cluster ports and cluster LIFs

[.lead]
You must set up cluster ports and LIFs. The following steps need to be performed on the site A nodes which were booted up with root aggregates.

. Identify the list of LIFs using the desired Cluster port: `network interface show -curr-port portname``network interface show -home-port portname`
. For each cluster port, change the home port of any of the LIFs on that port to another port,
 .. Enter advanced privilege mode and enter y when prompted to continue: `set priv advanced`
 .. If the LIF being modified is a data LIF: `vserver config override -command "network interface modify -lif lifname -vserver vservername -home-port new-datahomeport`
 .. If the LIF is not a data LIF: `network interface modify -lif lifname -vserver vservername -home-port new-datahomeport`
 .. Revert the modified LIFs to their home port: `network interface revert * -vserver vserver_name`
 .. Verify that there are no LIFs on the cluster port: `network interface show -curr-port portname``network interface show -home-port portname`
 .. Remove the port from the current broadcast domain: `network port broadcast-domain remove-ports -ipspace ipspacename -broadcast-domain bcastdomainname -ports node_name:port_name`
 .. Add the port to the cluster IPspace and broadcast domain: `network port broadcast-domain add-ports -ipspace Cluster -broadcast-domain Cluster -ports node_name:port_name`
 .. Verify that the port's role has changed: `network port show`
 .. Repeat these substeps for each cluster port.
 .. Return to admin mode: `set priv admin`
. Create cluster LIFs on the new cluster ports:
 .. For autoconfiguration using link-local address for cluster LIF, use the following command: `network interface create -vserver Cluster -lif cluster_lifname -service-policy default-cluster -home-node a1name -home-port clusterport -auto true`
 .. To assign static IP address for the cluster LIF, use the following command: `network interface create -vserver Cluster -lif cluster_lifname -service-policy default-cluster -home-node a1name -home-port clusterport -address ip-address -netmask netmask -status-admin up`

=== Verifying LIF configuration

[.lead]
The node management LIF, cluster management LIF and intercluster LIF will still be present after the storage movement from the old controller. If necessary, you must move LIFs to appropriate ports.

. Verify if the management LIF and cluster management LIFs are on desired port already: `network interface show -service-policy default-management``network interface show -service-policy default-intercluster`
+
If the LIFs are on the desired ports, you can skip the rest of the steps in this task and proceed to the next task.

. For each node, cluster management, or intercluster LIFs are not on the desired port, change the home port of any of the LIFs on that port to another port,
 .. Repurpose the desired port by moving any LIFs hosted on desired port to another port using `vserver config override -command "network interface modify -lif <lifname> -vserver <vservername> -home-port <new-datahomeport>`
 .. Revert the modified LIFs to their new home port: `vserver config override -command "network interface revert -lif <lifname> -vserver <vservername>"`
 .. If the desired port is not in the right IPspace and broadcast domain, remove the port from the current IPspace and broadcast domain: `network port broadcast-domain remove-ports -ipspace <current-ipspace> -broadcast-domain <current-broadcast-domain> -ports <controller-name:current-port>`
 .. Move the desired port to the right IPspace and broadcast domain``network port broadcast-domain add-ports -ipspace <new-ipspace> -broadcast-domain <new-broadcast-domain> -ports <controller-name:new-port>``
 .. Verify that the port's role has changed: `network port show`
 .. Repeat these substeps for each port.
. Move node, cluster management LIFs and intercluster LIF to the desired port using the following commands:
 .. Change the LIF's home port: `network interface modify -vserver vserver -lif node_mgmt -home-port port -home-node homenode`
 .. Revert the LIF to its new home port: `network interface revert -lif node_mgmt -vserver vservername`
 .. Change the cluster management LIF's home port:``network interface modify -vserver vserver -lif cluster-mgmt-LIF-name -home-port port -home-node homenode``
 .. Revert the cluster management LIF to its new home port: `network interface revert -lif cluster-mgmt-LIF-name -vserver vservername`
 .. Change the intercluster LIF's home port:``network interface modify -vserver vserver -lif intercluster-lif-name -home-node nodename -home-port port``
 .. Revert the intercluster LIF to its new home port: `network interface revert -lifintercluster-lif-name -vserver vservername`

== Bringing up node_A_2-IP and node_B_2-IP

[.lead]
You must bring up and configure the new MetroCluster IP node at each site, creating an HA pair in each site.

=== Bringing up node_A_2-IP and node_B_2-IP

[.lead]
You must boot the new controller modules one at a time using the correct option at the boot menu.

In these steps, you boot up the two brand new nodes, expanding what had been a two-node configuration into a four-node configuration.

These steps are performed on the following nodes:

* node_A_2-IP
* node_B_2-IP

image::../media/transition_2n_booting_a_2_and_b_2.png[]

. Boot the new nodes using boot option `9c`.

----
Please choose one of the following:
(1) Normal Boot.
(2) Boot without /etc/rc.
(3) Change password.
(4) Clean configuration and initialize all disks.
(5) Maintenance mode boot.
(6) Update flash from backup config.
(7) Install new software first.
(8) Reboot node.
(9) Configure Advanced Drive Partitioning. Selection (1-9)? 9c
----
