= Disruptively transitioning from a two-node MetroCluster FC to a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration (ONTAP 9.8 and later)

[.lead]
Starting with ONTAP 9.8, you can transition workloads and data from an existing two-node MetroCluster FC configuration to a new four-node MetroCluster IP configuration. Disk shelves from the MetroCluster FC nodes are moved to the IP nodes.

The following illustration provides a simplified view of the configuration before and after this transition procedure.

* This procedure is supported on systems running ONTAP 9.8 and later.
* This procedure is disruptive.
* This procedure applies only to a two-node MetroCluster FC configuration.
+
If you have a four-node MetroCluster FC configuration, see xref:concept_choosing_your_transition_procedure_mcc_transition.adoc[Choosing your transition procedure].

* ADP is not supported on the four-node MetroCluster IP configuration created by this procedure.
* You must meet all requirements and follow all steps in the procedure.
* The existing storage shelves are moved to the new MetroCluster IP nodes.
* Additional storage shelves can be added to the configuration if necessary.
