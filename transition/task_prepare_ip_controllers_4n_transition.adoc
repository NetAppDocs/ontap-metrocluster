You must prepare the four new MetroCluster IP nodes and install the correct ONTAP version.

This task must be performed on each of the new nodes:

* node_A_1-IP
* node_A_2-IP
* node_B_1-IP
* node_B_2-IP

In these steps, you clear the configuration on the nodes and clear the mailbox region on new drives.

. Rack the new controllers for the MetroCluster IP configuration.
+
The MetroCluster FC nodes (node_A_x-FC and node_B_x-FC) remain cabled at this time.

. Cable the MetroCluster IP nodes to the IP switches as shown in the link:../install-ip/using_rcf_generator.html[Cabling the IP switches].

. Configure the MetroCluster IP nodes using the following sections:
+
 .. link:../install-ip/task_sw_config_gather_info.html[Gather required information]
 .. link:../install-ip/task_sw_config_restore_defaults.html[Restore system defaults on a controller module]
 .. link:../install-ip/task_sw_config_verify_haconfig.html[Verify the ha-config state of components]
 .. link:../install-ip/task_sw_config_assign_pool0.html[Manually assign drives for pool 0 (ONTAP 9.4 and later)]

. From Maintenance mode, issue the halt command to exit Maintenance mode, and then issue the boot_ontap command to boot the system and get to cluster setup.
+
Do not complete the cluster wizard or node wizard at this time.

. Repeat these steps on the other MetroCluster IP nodes.
