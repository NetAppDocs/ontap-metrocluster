Then transitioning to a MetroCluster IP configuration, you must have a combination of supported platform models.

The following table shows the supported platform combinations. You can transition from platforms in the left-hand column to platforms listed as supported in the columns to the right, as indicated by the green table cells.

* A green cell shows that the combination is supported.
* A white (blank) cell indicates that the combination is unsupported.

For example, transitioning from a MetroCluster FC configuration consisting of AFF8060 controller modules to an IP configuration consisting of AFF A400 controller modules is supported.
