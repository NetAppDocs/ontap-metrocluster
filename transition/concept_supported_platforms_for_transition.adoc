[.lead]
When transitioning to a MetroCluster IP configuration, you must have a combination of supported platform models.

The following table shows the supported platform combinations. You can transition from platforms in the left-hand column to platforms listed as supported in the columns to the right, as indicated by the green table cells.

* A green cell shows that the combination is supported.
* A white (blank) cell indicates that the combination is unsupported.

For example, transitioning from a MetroCluster FC configuration consisting of AFF8060 controller modules to an IP configuration consisting of AFF A400 controller modules is supported.

== Transitions to a Cisco 9336C-FX2 shared switch configuration

Transitioning to a Cisco 9336C-FX2 shared switch configuration is not supported. A _shared switch configuration_ is one where the switches provide both the MetroCluster connections and the storage shelf connections.

Configurations in which the Cisco 9336C-FX2 switch provides only the MetroCluster connections are supported.
