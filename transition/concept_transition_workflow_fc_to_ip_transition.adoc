[.lead]
You must follow the specific workflow to ensure a successful nondisruptive transition. Choose the workflow for your configuration:

*  <<Four-node FC configuration transition workflow>>
*  <<Eight-node FC configuration transition workflow>>

== Four-node FC configuration transition workflow

The transition process begins with a healthy four-node MetroCluster FC configuration.

The new MetroCluster IP nodes are added as a second DR group.

Data is transferred from the old DR group to the new DR group, and then the old nodes and their storage are removed from the configuration and decommissioned. The process ends with a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration.

== Eight-node FC configuration transition workflow

The transition process begins with a healthy eight-node MetroCluster FC configuration.

The new MetroCluster IP nodes are added as a third DR group.

Data is transferred from the old DR group to the new DR group, and then the old nodes and their storage are removed from the configuration and decommissioned. This process is repeated for the second FC DR group (DR_group_2-FC).

The process ends with an eight-node MetroCluster IP configuration.

NOTE: If you want to transition an eight-node FC configuration to a four-node IP configuration, you only need transition one FC DR group. You can then remove the old FC DR groups. After the FC DR groups have been removed, the process ends with a four-node MetroCluster IP configuration. 

== Transition process workflow

You will use the following workflow to transition the MetroCluster configuration.
