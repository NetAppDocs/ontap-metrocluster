The various MetroCluster configurations have key differences in the required components.

In all configurations, each of the two MetroCluster sites is configured as an ONTAP cluster. In a two-node MetroCluster configuration, each node is configured as a single-node cluster.

*Note the following considerations for eight-node MetroCluster IP configurations:
* Only NetApp-validated MetroCluster switches (ordered from NetApp) are supported.
* Configurations using IP-routed (layer 3) backend connections are not supported.
* Configurations using sharing private layer 2 networks are not supported.
