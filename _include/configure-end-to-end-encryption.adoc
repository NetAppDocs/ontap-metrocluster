Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, you can configure end-to-end encryption on AFF A400, FAS8300, or FAS8700 systems to encrypt back-end traffic, such as NVlog and storage replication data, between the nodes in a MetroCluster IP configuration. 

.About this task

* End-to-end encryption is only supported in MetroCluster IP configurations running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later on AFF A400, FAS8300, or FAS8700 systems. 
* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* Before you can configure end-to-end encryption, you must link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/encryption-at-rest/configure-external-key-management-concept.html[Configure external key management^].


== Enable end-to-end encryption

Perform the following steps to enable end-to-end encryption. 

.Steps

. Verify the health of the MetroCluster configuration.
.. Verify that the MetroCluster components are healthy:
+
`metrocluster check run`
+
----
cluster_A::*> metrocluster check run

----
+
The operation runs in the background.

.. After the `metrocluster check run` operation completes, run `metrocluster check show` to view the results.
+
After approximately five minutes, the following results are displayed:
+
----
-----------
::*> metrocluster check show

Component           Result
------------------- ---------
nodes               ok
lifs                ok
config-replication  ok
aggregates          warning
clusters            ok
connections         not-applicable
volumes             ok
7 entries were displayed.
----

.. Check the status of the running MetroCluster check operation:
+
`metrocluster operation history show -job-id 38`
.. Verify that there are no health alerts:
+
`system health alert show`

. Verify that external key management is configured on both clusters: 
+
[source,cli]
security key-manager external show-status

. Enable end-to-end encryption for each DR group:
+
[source,cli]
metrocluster modify -is-encryption-enabled true -dr-group-id <dr_group_id>
+
*Example*
+
----
cluster_A::*> metrocluster modify -is-encryption-enabled true -dr-group-id 1         
[Job 244] Job succeeded: Modify is successful.
----
+
Repeat this step for each DR group in the configuration.

. Verify that end-to-end encryption is enabled:
+
[source,cli]
metrocluster node show -fields is-encryption-enabled
+
*Example*
+
----
cluster_A::*> metrocluster node show -fields is-encryption-enabled

dr-group-id cluster    node      configuration-state is-encryption-enabled
----------- ---------- --------  ------------------- -----------------
1           cluster_A  node_A_1  configured          true                 
1           cluster_A  node_A_2  configured          true                 
1           cluster_B  node_B_1  configured          true                 
1           cluster_B  node_B_2  configured          true
