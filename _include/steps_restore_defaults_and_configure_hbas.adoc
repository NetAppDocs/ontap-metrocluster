To ensure a successful MetroCluster installation, reset and restore defaults on the controller modules.

*Important*

This task is only required for stretch configurations using FC-to-SAS bridges.

.Steps

. At the LOADER prompt, return the environmental variables to their default setting:
+
`set-defaults`

. Boot the node into Maintenance mode, and then configure the settings for any HBAs in the system:
.. Boot into Maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

.. Check the current settings of the ports:
+
`ucadmin show`

.. Update the port settings as needed.

h| If you have this type of HBA and desired mode... h| Use this command...

a| CNA FC
a| `ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator _adapter_name_`
a| CNA Ethernet
a| `ucadmin modify -mode cna _adapter_name_`
a| FC target
a| `fcadmin config -t target _adapter_name_`
a| FC initiator
a| `fcadmin config -t initiator _adapter_name_`

|===

. Exit Maintenance mode:
+
`halt`
+
After you run the command, wait until the node stops at the LOADER prompt.

. Boot the node back into Maintenance mode to enable the configuration changes to take effect:
