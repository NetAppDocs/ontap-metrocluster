NetApp strongly recommends that you enable console logging on the devices that you are using and take the following actions when performing this procedure:

* Leave AutoSupport enabled during maintenance.
 
* Trigger a maintenance AutoSupport message before and after maintenance to disable case creation for the duration of the maintenance activity.

* Enable session logging for any CLI session. For instructions on how to enable session logging, review the "Logging Session Output" section in the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/Ontap_OS/OS-KBs/How_to_configure_PuTTY_for_optimal_connectivity_to_ONTAP_systems[How to configure PuTTY for optimal connectivity to ONTAP systems^].
