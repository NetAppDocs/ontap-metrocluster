You must verify the HA state of the controllers and chassis, and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

.Steps

. In Maintenance mode, display the HA state of the controller module and chassis:
+
`ha-config show`
+
The HA state for all components should be `mccip`.

. If the displayed system state of the controller or chassis is not correct, set the HA state:
+
`ha-config modify controller mccip`
+
`ha-config modify chassis mccip`

. Verify and modify the Ethernet ports connected to NS224 shelves or storage switches.
+
.. Verify the Ethernet ports connected to NS224 shelves or storage switches:
+
`storage port show`
+
.. Set all Ethernet ports connected to Ethernet shelves or storage switches, including shared switches for storage and cluster, to `storage` mode:
+ 
`storage port modify -p <port> -m storage` 
+
NOTE: This must be set on all affected ports for a successful upgrade.
+
Disks from the shelves attached to the Ethernet ports are reported in the `sysconfig -v` output. 
+
Refer to the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for information on the storage ports for the system you are upgrading to.

.. Verify that `storage` mode is set and confirm the ports are in the online state:
+
`storage port show`

. Halt the node: `halt`
+
The node should stop at the `LOADER>` prompt.

.	On each node, check the system date, time, and time zone: `show date`
.	If necessary, set the date in UTC or GMT: `set date <mm/dd/yyyy>`
.	Check the time by using the following command at the boot environment prompt: `show time`
.	If necessary, set the time in UTC or GMT: `set time <hh:mm:ss>`

.	Save the settings: `saveenv`
.	Gather environment variables: `printenv`
