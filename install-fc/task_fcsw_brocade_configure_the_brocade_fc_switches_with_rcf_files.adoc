To configure a Brocade FC switch, you must reset the switch settings to factory defaults, install the switch software, and download and apply the reference configuration (RCF) files that provide the complete switch settings for certain configurations.

.Before you begin

You must have access to an FTP server. The switches must have connectivity with the FTP server.

.About this task

Each configuration file is different and must be used with the correct switch. Only one of the configuration files for each switch fabric contains zoning commands.
