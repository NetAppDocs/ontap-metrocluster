[.lead]
If you are setting up a two-node fabric-attached MetroCluster configuration with array LUNs, you must cable the FC-VI ports and the HBA ports to the switch ports.

.About this task

* You must repeat this task for each controller at both of the MetroCluster sites.
* If you plan to use disks in addition to array LUNs in your MetroCluster configuration, you must use the HBA ports and switch ports specified for configuration with disks.

.Steps

. Cable the FC-VI ports from the controller to alternate switch ports.
. Perform the controller-to-switch cabling at both of the MetroCluster sites.
+
You must ensure redundancy in connections from the controller to the switches. Therefore, for each controller at a site, you must ensure that both of the HBA ports in the same port pair are connected to alternate FC switches.
+
The following example shows the connections between the HBA ports on Controller A and ports on FC_switch_A_1 and FC_switch_A_2:

The following table lists the connections between the HBA ports and the FC switch ports in the illustration:

FC_switch_A_1, Port 2

Port b

.After you finish

You should cable the ISLs between the FC switches across the MetroCluster sites.
