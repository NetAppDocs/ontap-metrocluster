If you want to simplify the process of configuring switches, you can download and apply reference configuration files that provide the complete switch settings for certain configurations.

The reference configuration files (RCFs) do not support configurations using eight ISLs. If you are using eight ISLs you must configure the switches manually.

The RCFs apply to two-node, four-node, and eight-node MetroCluster configurations. These files configure the fabric for in-order delivery (IOD) by default.

The RCF download page indicates the number of nodes supported by the different switch models.
