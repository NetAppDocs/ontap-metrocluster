For fabric-attached MetroCluster systems that were not pre-configured in the factory, you must configure each FC switch in the DR group. This is done manually, or, depending on the switch, can optionally be done with a configuration file.

For new systems, the FC switch fabrics are typically configured for two ISLs and do not require additional configuration unless you want to change the pre-configured IP addresses.
