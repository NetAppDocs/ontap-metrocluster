You can remove the MetroCluster configuration from all nodes in the MetroCluster configuration or all of the nodes in a disaster recovery (DR) group. After removing the MetroCluster configuration, all disk connectivity and interconnects should be adjusted to be in a supported state. If you need to remove the MetroCluster configuration, contact technical support.

IMPORTANT: You cannot reverse the MetroCluster unconfiguration. This process should only be done with the assistance of technical support.
