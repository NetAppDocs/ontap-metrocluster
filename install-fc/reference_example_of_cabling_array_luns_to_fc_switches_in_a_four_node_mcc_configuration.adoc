In a MetroCluster configuration with array LUNs, you must connect the storage array ports that form a redundant port pair to alternate FC switches.

The following reference illustration shows the connections between storage arrays and FC switches in a four-node MetroCluster configuration with array LUNs:

image::../media/four_node_mcc_configuration_with_array_luns.gif[This graphic depicts an example MetroCluster configuration with array LUNs. The graphic is described by the surrounding text.]

NOTE: If you plan to use disks in addition to array LUNs in your MetroCluster configuration, you must use the switch ports specified for the configuration with disks.

xref:concept_port_assignments_for_fc_switches_when_using_ontap_9_1_and_later.adoc[Port assignments for FC switches when using ONTAP 9.1 and later]

In the illustration, the redundant array port pairs for both the sites are as follows:

* Storage array at Site A:
 ** Ports 1A and 2A
 ** Ports 1B and 2B
 ** Ports 1C and 2C
 ** Ports 1D and 2D
* Storage array at Site B:
 ** Ports 1A' and 2A'
 ** Ports 1B' and 2B'
 ** Ports 1C' and 2C'
 ** Ports 1D' and 2D'

FC_switch_A_1 at Site A and FC_switch_B_1 at Site B are connected to form fabric_1. Similarly, FC_switch_A_2 at Site A and FC_switch_B_2 are connected to form fabric_2.

The following table lists the connections between the storage array ports and the FC switches for the MetroCluster illustration:
