Array LUNs must be owned by a node before they can be added to an aggregate to be used as storage.

* Back-end configuration testing (testing of the connectivity and configuration of devices behind the ONTAP systems) must be completed.
* Array LUNs that you want to assign must be presented to the ONTAP systems.

You can assign ownership of array LUNs that have the following characteristics:

* They are unowned.
* They have no storage array configuration errors, such as the following:
 ** The array LUN is smaller than or larger than the size that ONTAP supports.
 ** The LDEV is mapped on only one port.
 ** The LDEV has inconsistent LUN IDs assigned to it.
 ** The LUN is available on only one path.

ONTAP issues an error message if you try to assign ownership of an array LUN with back-end configuration errors that would interfere with the ONTAP system and the storage array operating together. You must fix such errors before you can proceed with array LUN assignment.

ONTAP alerts you if you try to assign an array LUN with a redundancy error: for example, all paths to this array LUN are connected to the same controller or only one path to the array LUN. You can fix a redundancy error before or after assigning ownership of the LUN.

. Enter the following command to see the array LUNs that have not yet been assigned to a node:``storage disk show -container-type unassigned``
. Enter the following command to assign an array LUN to this node:``storage disk assign -disk arrayLUNname -owner nodename``
+
If you want to fix a redundancy error after disk assignment instead of before, you must use the -force parameter with the storage disk assign command.
