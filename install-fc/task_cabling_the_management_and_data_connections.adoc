You must cable the management and data ports on each storage controller to the site networks.

This task must be repeated for each new controller at both MetroCluster sites.

You can connect the controller and cluster switch management ports to existing switches in your network or to new dedicated network switches such as NetApp CN1601 cluster management switches.

. Cable the controller's management and data ports to the management and data networks at the local site.
