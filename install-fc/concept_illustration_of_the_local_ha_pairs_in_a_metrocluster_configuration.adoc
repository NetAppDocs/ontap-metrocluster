In eight-node or four-node MetroCluster configurations, each site consists of storage controllers configured as one or two HA pairs. This allows local redundancy so that if one storage controller fails, its local HA partner can take over. Such failures can be handled without a MetroCluster switchover operation.

Local HA failover and giveback operations are performed with the storage failover commands, in the same manner as a non-MetroCluster configuration.
