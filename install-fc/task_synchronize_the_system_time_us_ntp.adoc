[.lead]
Each cluster needs its own Network Time Protocol (NTP) server to synchronize the time between the nodes and their clients. You can use the Edit DateTime dialog box in System Manager to configure the NTP server.

.About this task

* You cannot modify the time zone settings for a failed node or the partner node after a takeover occurs.
* Each cluster in the MetroCluster FC configuration should have its own separate NTP server or servers used by the nodes, FC switches, and FC-to-SAS bridges at that MetroCluster site.
+
If you are using the MetroCluster Tiebreaker software, it should also have its own separate NTP server.
