[.lead]
You can configure FAS8200 and AFF A300 systems using a single initiator port for each fabric and two initiator ports for each controller.

You can follow the cabling for the FibreBridge 7600N bridge using only one FC port (FC1 or FC2). Instead of using four initiators, connect only two initiators and leave the other two that are connected to the switch port empty.

If zoning is performed manually, then follow the zoning used for a FibreBridge 7600N bridge using one FC port (FC1 or FC2). In this scenario, one initiator port rather than two is added to each zone member per fabric.

You can change the zoning or perform an upgrade from a FibreBridge 6500N to a FibreBridge 7500N using the procedure in link:../maintain/task_replace_a_sle_fc_to_sas_bridge.html#hot_swap_6500n[Hot-swapping a FibreBridge 6500N bridge with a FibreBridge 7600N or 7500N bridge].

The following table shows port assignments for Brocade FC switches when using a single initiator port for each fabric and two initiator ports for each controller.
