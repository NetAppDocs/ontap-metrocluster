== Considerations for using All SAN Array systems in MetroCluster configurations

Some All SAN Arrays (ASAs) are supported in MetroCluster configurations. In the MetroCluster documentation, the information for AFF models applies to the corresponding ASA system. For example, all cabling and other information for the AFF A400 system also applies to the ASA AFF A400 system.

Supported platform configurations are listed in the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe].
