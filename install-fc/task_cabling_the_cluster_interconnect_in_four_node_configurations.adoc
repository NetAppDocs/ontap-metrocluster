In eight- or four-node MetroCluster configurations, you must cable the cluster interconnect between the local controller modules at each site.

This task is not required on two-node MetroCluster configurations.

This task must be performed at both MetroCluster sites.

. Cable the cluster interconnect from one controller module to the other, or if cluster interconnect switches are used, from each controller module to the switches.
