To easily disable potentially unsecure Ethernet protocols on a bridge, beginning with ONTAP 9.5 you can secure the bridge. This disables the bridge's Ethernet ports. You can also reenable Ethernet access.

* Securing the bridge disables telnet and other IP port protocols and services (FTP, ExpressNAV, ICMP, or QuickNAV) on the bridge.
* This procedure uses out-of-band management using the ONTAP prompt, which is available beginning with ONTAP 9.5.
+
You can issue the commands from the bridge CLI if you are not using out-of-band management.

* The `*unsecurebridge*` command can be used to reenable the Ethernet ports.
* In ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, running the `*securebridge*` command on the ATTO FibreBridge might not update the bridge status correctly on the partner cluster. If this occurs, run the `*securebridge*` command from the partner cluster.

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, the `*storage bridge*` command is replaced with `*system bridge*`. The following steps show the `*storage bridge*` command, but if you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later, the `*system bridge*` command is preferred.

.Steps
. From the ONTAP prompt of the cluster containing the bridge, secure or unsecure the bridge.
+
The following command secures bridge_A_1:
+
----
cluster_A> storage bridge run-cli -bridge bridge_A_1 -command securebridge
----
+
The following command unsecures bridge_A_1:
+
----
cluster_A> storage bridge run-cli -bridge bridge_A_1 -command unsecurebridge
----

. From the ONTAP prompt of the cluster containing the bridge, save the bridge configuration:
+
`*storage bridge run-cli -bridge _bridge-name_ -command saveconfiguration*`
+
The following command secures bridge_A_1:
+
----
cluster_A> storage bridge run-cli -bridge bridge_A_1 -command saveconfiguration
----

. From the ONTAP prompt of the cluster containing the bridge, restart the bridge's firmware:
+
`*storage bridge run-cli -bridge _bridge-name_ -command firmwarerestart*`
+
The following command secures bridge_A_1:
+
----
cluster_A> storage bridge run-cli -bridge bridge_A_1 -command firmwarerestart
