[.lead]
You can hot-add either an individual SAS disk shelf or a stack and set of bridges to an existing MetroCluster system.

These procedures apply to MetroCluster FC configurations using FC-to-SAS bridges that are either directly attached to the storage controllers or attached to an FC fabric.

These procedures are nondisruptive and take approximately four hours to complete.

You need the admin password and access to an FTP or SCP server.
