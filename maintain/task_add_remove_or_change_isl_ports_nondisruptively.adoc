[.lead]
You might need to add, remove, or change ISL ports on Cisco IP switches. You can convert dedicated ISL ports to shared ISL ports, or change the speed of ISL ports on a Cisco IP switch. ISLs traveling greater distances might require lower speeds to improve quality. If you are adding or upgrading hardware, you might need to increase the speed of ISL ports to take advantage of system upgrades and add ISLs to a Cisco IP switch.

.About this task

If you are converting dedicated ISL ports to shared ISL ports, ensure the new ports meet the link:../install-ip/concept_considerations_layer_2.html[Requirements for shared ISL ports].

You must complete all the steps on both switches to ensure ISL connectivity.

The following procedure assumes you are replacing a 10-Gb ISL connected at switch port Eth1/24/1 with two 100-Gb ISLs that are connected to switch ports 17 and 18.

.Before you begin

Refer to the *Switches* section of the link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to verify the supported transceivers.

.Steps
. Disable the ISL ports of the ISLs on both switches in the fabric that you want to change.
+
--
NOTE: You only need to disable the current ISL ports if you are moving them to a different port, or the speed of the ISL is changing. If you are adding an ISL port with the same speed as the existing ISLs, go to Step 3.
--

+
You must enter only one configuration command for each line and press Ctrl-Z after you have entered all the commands, as shown in the following example:
+
----

switch_A_1# conf t
switch_A_1(config)# int eth1/24/1
switch_A_1(config-if)# shut
switch_A_1(config-if)#
switch_A_1#

switch_B_1# conf t
switch_B_1(config)# int eth1/24/1
switch_B_1(config-if)# shut
switch_B_1(config-if)#
switch_B_1#
----

. Remove the existing cables and transceivers.
. Change the ISL port as required.

To change the speed of an ISL port...
a|
Cable the new ISLs to the designated ports according to their speeds. You must ensure that these ISL ports for your switch are listed in the _MetroCluster IP Installation and Configuration_.
a|
To add an ISL...
a|
Insert QFSPs into the ports you are adding as ISL ports. Ensure they are listed in the _MetroCluster IP Installation and Configuration_ and cable them accordingly.
|===

. Enable all ISL ports (if not enabled) on both switches in the fabric beginning with the following command:
+
`switch_A_1# conf t`
+
You must enter only one configuration command per line and press Ctrl-Z after you have entered all the commands:
+
----
switch_A_1# conf t
switch_A_1(config)# int eth1/17
switch_A_1(config-if)# no shut
switch_A_1(config-if)# int eth1/18
switch_A_1(config-if)# no shut
switch_A_1(config-if)#
switch_A_1#
switch_A_1# copy running-config startup-config

switch_B_1# conf t
switch_B_1(config)# int eth1/17
switch_B_1(config-if)# no shut
switch_B_1(config-if)# int eth1/18
switch_B_1(config-if)# no shut
switch_B_1(config-if)#
switch_B_1#
switch_B_1# copy running-config startup-config
----

. Verify that the ISLs are established between both switches:
+
`switch_A_1# show int eth1/17,eth1/18 brief`
+
You should see the ISL interfaces in the command output as shown in the following example:
+
----
switch_A_1# show int eth1/17,eth1/18 brief
