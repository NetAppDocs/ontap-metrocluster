= Power off and power on a single site in a MetroCluster FC configuration
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
If you need to perform site maintenance or relocate a single MetroCluster site, you must know how to power off and power on the site. 

If a site needs to be relocated and reconfigured (if you need to expand from a four-node to an eight-node cluster, for example), these tasks cannot be completed at the same time. This procedure only covers the steps that are required to perform site maintenance or to relocate a site without changing its configuration.

The following diagram shows a MetroCluster configuration.  Cluster_B is powered off for maintenance.

== Powering off a MetroCluster site

You must power off a site and all of the equipment before site maintenance or relocation can begin.
//GH issue 83 04/02/2022

.About this task

All the commands in the following steps are issued from the site to remain powered on.

.Steps

. Before you begin, check that any non-mirrored aggregates at the site are offline.

. Verify the operation of the MetroCluster configuration in ONTAP:

.. Check whether the system is multipathed:
+
`node run -node _node-name_ sysconfig -a`

.. Check for any health alerts on both clusters:
+
`system health alert show`

.. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is normal:
+
`metrocluster show`

.. Perform a MetroCluster check:
 +
`metrocluster check run`

.. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`metrocluster check show`

.. Check for any health alerts on the switches (if present):
+
`storage switch show`

.. Run Config Advisor.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[NetApp Downloads: Config Advisor]

.. After running Config Advisor, review the tool's output and follow the recommendations in the output to address any issues discovered.

. From the site you want to remain up implement the switchover:
+
`metrocluster switchover`
+
----
cluster_A::*> metrocluster switchover
----
+
The operation can take several minutes to complete.
+
The unmirrored aggregates will only be online after a switchover if the remote disks in the aggregate are accessible. If the ISLs fail, the local node may be unable to access the data in the unmirrored remote disks. The failure of an aggregate can lead to a reboot of the local node.

. Monitor and verify the completion of the switchover:
+
`metrocluster operation show`
+
----
cluster_A::*> metrocluster operation show
  Operation: Switchover
 Start time: 10/4/2012 19:04:13
State: in-progress
   End time: -
     Errors:

   End time: 10/4/2012 19:04:22

. Move any volumes and LUNs that belong to unmirrored aggregates offline.
.. Move the volumes offline.
+
----
cluster_A::* volume offline <volume name>
----
.. Move the LUNs offline.
+
----
cluster_A::* lun offline lun_path <lun_path>
----

. Move unmirrored aggregates offline: `storage aggregate offline`
+
----
cluster_A*::> storage aggregate offline -aggregate <aggregate-name>
----

. Depending on your configuration and ONTAP version, identify and move offline affected plexes that are located at the disaster site (Cluster_B).
+
You should move the following plexes offline:
+
--
* Non-mirrored plexes residing on disks located at the disaster site.
+
If you do not move the non-mirrored plexes at the disaster site offline, an outage might result when the disaster site is later powered off.
+
* Mirrored plexes residing on disks located at the disaster site for aggregate mirroring.
After they are moved offline, the plexes are inaccessible.
--

.. Identify the affected plexes.
+
Plexes that are owned by nodes at the surviving site consist of Pool1 disks. Plexes that are owned by nodes at the disaster site consist of Pool0 disks.

. Power off the site.
+
The following equipment must be turned off in the order shown:
+
** MetroCluster FC switches
** Storage controllers - the storage controllers should currently be at the `LOADER` prompt, you must power them off completely.
** Storage shelves
** ATTO FibreBridges (if present)

== Relocating the powered-off site of the MetroCluster

After the site is powered off, you can begin maintenance work. The procedure is the same whether the MetroCluster components are relocated within the same data center or relocated to a different data center.

* The hardware should be cabled in the same way as the previous site.
* If the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) speed, length, or number has changed, they all need to be reconfigured.

.Steps

. Make sure that the cabling for all components is carefully recorded so that it can be correctly reconnected at the new location.

. Physically relocate all the hardware, storage controllers, FC switches, FibreBridges, and storage shelves.

. Configure the ISL ports and verify the intersite connectivity.

.. Power on the FC switches.
+
NOTE: Do *not* power up any other equipment.

.. Enable the ports.

== Powering on the MetroCluster configuration and returning to normal operation

After maintenance has been completed or the site has been moved, you must power on the site and reestablish the MetroCluster configuration.

.About this task

All the commands in the following steps are issued from the site that you power on.

.Steps

. Power on the switches.
+
Switches should be powered on first. They might have been powered on during the previous step if the site was relocated.

.. Reconfigure the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) if required or if this was not completed as part of the relocation.

.. Enable the ISL if fencing was completed.

.. Verify the ISL.

. Disable the ISLs on the FC switches.

. Power on the storage controllers and wait until you see the `LOADER` prompt. The controllers must not be fully booted. 
+
If auto boot is enabled, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the controllers from automatically booting. 

. Power on the shelves and allow enough time for them to power on completely.

. Power on the FibreBridge bridges.

.. On the FC switches, verify that the ports connecting the bridges are coming online.
+
You can use a command such as `switchshow` for Brocade switches, and `show interface brief` for Cisco switches.

.. Verify that the shelves and disks on the bridges are clearly visible.
+
You can use a command such as `sastargets` on the ATTO command-line interface (CLI).

. Enable the ISLs on the FC switches.
+
Enable the ports based on whether you are using Brocade or Cisco switches as shown in the following table:
