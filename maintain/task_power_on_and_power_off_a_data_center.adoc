= Powering off and powering on a data center
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You must know how to power off and power on a data center for the purpose of site maintenance or to relocate a site to another location.

If a site needs to be relocated and reconfigured (if you need to expand from a four-node to an eight-node cluster, for example), these tasks cannot be completed at the same time. This procedure only covers the steps that are required to perform site maintenance or to relocate a site without changing its configuration.

The following diagram shows a MetroCluster configuration.  Cluster_B is powered off for maintenance.

NOTE: This procedure is for use in both MetroCluster IP and FC configurations.

== Powering off a MetroCluster site

You must power off a site and all of the equipment before site maintenance or relocation can begin.
//GH issue 83 04/02/2022

.About this task

All the commands in the following steps are issued from the site to remain powered on.

.Steps

. Before you begin, check that any non-mirrored aggregates at the site are offline.

. Verify the operation of the MetroCluster configuration in ONTAP:

.. Check whether the system is multipathed:
+
`node run -node _node-name_ sysconfig -a`

.. Check for any health alerts on both clusters:
+
`system health alert show`

.. Confirm the MetroCluster configuration and that the operational mode is normal:
+
`metrocluster show`

.. Perform a MetroCluster check:
 +
`metrocluster check run`

.. Display the results of the MetroCluster check:
+
`metrocluster check show`

.. Check for any health alerts on the switches (if present):
+
`storage switch show`

.. Run Config Advisor.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[NetApp Downloads: Config Advisor]

.. After running Config Advisor, review the tool's output and follow the recommendations in the output to address any issues discovered.

. From the site you want to remain up implement the switchover:
+
`metrocluster switchover`
+
----
cluster_A::*> metrocluster Switchover
----
+
The operation can take several minutes to complete.
+
[ATTENTION]
====
In MetroCluster FC configurations, the unmirrored aggregates will only be online after a switchover if the remote disks in the aggregate are accessible. If the ISLs fail, the local node may be unable to access the data in the unmirrored remote disks. The failure of an aggregate can lead to a reboot of the local node.
====

. Monitor and verify the completion of the switchover:
+
`metrocluster operation show`
+
----
cluster_A::*> metrocluster operation show
  Operation: Switchover
 Start time: 10/4/2012 19:04:13
State: in-progress
   End time: -
     Errors:

cluster_A::*> metrocluster operation show
  Operation: Switchover
 Start time: 10/4/2012 19:04:13
      State: successful
   End time: 10/4/2012 19:04:22
     Errors: -
----

. If you have a MetroCluster IP configuration running ONTAP 9.6 or later, wait for the disaster site plexes to come online and the healing operations to automatically complete.
+
In MetroCluster IP configurations running earlier versions of ONTAP, the disaster site nodes do not automatically boot to ONTAP and the plexes remain offline. For MetroCluster FC configurations, all plexes remain online and you do not need to online the plexes.
. Move volumes and LUNs offline.
.. Move volumes offline:
+
----
cluster_A::* volume offline <volume name>
----
.. Move LUNs offline.
+
----
cluster_A::* lun offline lun_path <lun_path>
----

. Move unmirrored aggregates offline: `storage aggregate offline`.
+
----
cluster_A*::> storage aggregate offline -aggregate <aggregate-name>
----

. Depending on your configuration and ONTAP version, identify and move offline affected plexes that are located at the disaster site (Cluster_B).
+
[NOTE]
====
This step is required in the following configurations:.

* All MetroCluster FC configurations.
* MetroCluster IP configurations running ONTAP version 9.6 or later.
====

+
You should move the following plexes offline:
+
--
* Non-mirrored plexes residing on disks located at the disaster site.
+
If you do not move the non-mirrored plexes at the disaster site offline, an outage might result when the disaster site is later powered off.
+
* Mirrored plexes residing on disks located at the disaster site for aggregate mirroring.
After they are moved offline, the plexes are inaccessible.
--

.. Identify the affected plexes.
+
Plexes that are owned by nodes at the surviving site consist of Pool1 disks. Plexes that are owned by nodes at the disaster site consist of Pool0 disks.

The following equipment needs to be turned off in no specific order:

h| Configuration type h| Equipment to be powered off
a|
In a MetroCluster IP configuration, power off...
a|

 ** MetroCluster IP switches
 ** Storage controllers
 ** Storage shelves

a|
In a MetroCluster FC configuration, power off...
a|

 ** MetroCluster FC switches
 ** Storage controllers
 ** Storage shelves
 ** Atto FibreBridges (if present)

+
|===

== Relocating the powered-off site of the MetroCluster

[.lead]
After the site is powered off, you can begin maintenance work. The procedure is the same whether the MetroCluster components are relocated within the same data center or relocated to a different data center.

* The hardware should be cabled in the same way as the previous site.
* If the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) speed, length, or number has changed, they all need to be reconfigured.

.Steps

. Make sure that the cabling for all components is carefully recorded so that it can be correctly reconnected at the new location.

. Physically relocate all the hardware, storage controllers, FC and IP switches, FibreBridges, and storage shelves.

. Configure the ISL ports and verify the intersite connectivity.

.. Power on the FC and IP switches.
+
NOTE: Do *not* power up any other equipment.

.. Enable the ports.
+
NOTE: This step is only required in MetroCluster FC configurations. You can skip this step if your configuration is a MetroCluster IP configuration.
+

Enable the ports according to the correct switch types in the following table:

== Powering on the MetroCluster configuration and returning to normal operation

[.lead]
After maintenance has been completed or the site has been moved, you must power on the site and reestablish the MetroCluster configuration.

.About this task

All the commands in the following steps are issued from the site that you power on.

.Steps

. Power on the switches.
+
Switches should be powered on first. They might have been powered on during the previous step if the site was relocated.

.. Reconfigure the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) if required or if this was not completed as part of the relocation.

.. Enable the ISL if fencing was completed.

.. Verify the ISL.

. Power on the storage controllers.

. Power on the shelves and allow enough time for them to power on completely.

. Power on the FibreBridge bridges.
+
NOTE: You can skip this step if your configuration is a MetroCluster IP configuration.

.. On the FC switches, verify that the ports connecting the bridges are coming online.
+
You can use a command such as `switchshow` for Brocade switches, and `show interface brief` for Cisco switches.

.. Verify that the shelves and disks on the bridges are clearly visible.
+
You can use a command such as `sastargets` on the ATTO command-line interface (CLI).

. Enable the ISLs on the FC switches.
+
NOTE: Skip this step if your configuration is a MetroCluster IP configuration.
+

Enable the ports based on whether you are using Brocade or Cisco switches as shown in the following table:

[cols="35,65"]
|===

h| If your configuration is... h| Then perform this step...
a|
MetroCluster IP configuration
a|
Verify that the local storage is visible from the node Maintenance mode.
a|
MetroCluster FC configuration
a|
Verify that the storage is visible from the surviving site. Put the offline plexes back online. This restarts the resync operations and reestablishes the SyncMirror.

|===

. Reestablish the MetroCluster configuration.
+
Follow the instructions in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/disaster-recovery/concept_dr_workflow.html[MetroCluster management and disaster recovery] to perform healing and switchback operations according to your MetroCluster configuration.
