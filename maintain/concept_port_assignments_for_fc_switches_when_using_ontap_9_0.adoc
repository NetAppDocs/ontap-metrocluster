[.lead]
You need to verify that you are using the specified port assignments when you cable the FC switches. The port assignments are different between ONTAP 9.0 and later versions of ONTAP.

Ports that are not used for attaching initiator ports, FC-VI ports, or ISLs can be reconfigured to act as storage ports. However, if the supported RCFs are being used, the zoning must be changed accordingly.

If the supported RCF files are used, ISL ports may not connect to the same ports shown here and may need to be reconfigured manually.

== Overall cabling guidelines

You should be aware of the following guidelines when using the cabling tables:

* The Brocade and Cisco switches use different port numbering:
 ** On Brocade switches, the first port is numbered 0.
 ** On Cisco switches, the first port is numbered 1.
* The cabling is the same for each FC switch in the switch fabric.
* AFF A300 and FAS8200 storage systems can be ordered with one of two options for FC-VI connectivity:
 ** Onboard ports 0e and 0f configured in FC-VI mode.
 ** Ports 1a and 1b on an FC-VI card in slot 1.
